  "complaint_what_happened": "I was the victim of identity theft on two Bank of America credit cards ; one was a VISA and the other was a XXXX for small business. For the VISA, I reported the fraudulent transactions to Bank of America. The agent advised me to destroy the credit card and that they would send a new card to me. When I went into my wallet, I found that the card was gone and had been stolen. I reported this to the agent, and the fraudulent charges were credited back to my account on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$3400.00}. However, on XX/XX/XXXX the fraudulent charges in the amount of {$2900.00} were added right back into my account! For the XXXX for small business, I reported the fraudulent transactions to Bank of America. The agent advised me to destroy the credit card and that they would send a new card to me. When I went into my wallet, I found that the card was gone and had been stolen. I reported this to the agent, and the fraudulent charges were credited back to my account on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$4700.00}. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, the fraudulent charges were reversed right back into my account! I am refusing to pay these fraudulent charges, and understand that the VISA and XXXX products expressly state that customers are not liable for fraudulent charges. Why, then, does Bank of America continue to blame me, the victim of the fraud, for these charges? This bank is absolutely horrible, and even though I have been with them for 35 years and am now a \" Gold '' status member, I am looking to leave as soon as I get these fraudulent charges fixed. Shame on you, Bank of America! On XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America responded : Wed like to let you know that weve resolved XXXX XXXX case. Our records indicate the fraud claim for the business account ending in XXXX, for XXXX charges. The claim was reviewed and on XX/XX/XXXX, the claim was partially denied. On XX/XX/XXXX, we spoke to our client and he partially withdrew the remaining of the claim for {$2900.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, we spoke with XXXX XXXX regarding his complaint in reference to his Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards credit card ending in XXXX. During our conversation, we discussed the fraud claim XXXX for credit card ending in XXXX previously XXXX for {$3400.00}, was partially denied. A credit for {$470.00} was applied on XX/XX/XXXX, and the {$2900.00}, credit that was previously applied to the account was removed. Additionally, XXXX XXXX provided additional information and an additional review was completed however it was determined that our decision remained unchanged. XXXX XXXX had no additional questions or concerns; thus settling this matter. On XX/XX/XXXX, I responded : On XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America responded to my claim by stating : \" Additionally, XXXX XXXX provided additional information and an additional review was completed however it was determined that our decision remained unchanged. XXXX XXXX had no additional questions or concerns; thus settling this matter. '' Firstly, they do not state what the \" additional information '' was. In fact, this was a XXXX police report of the identity theft itself. That is the whole issue here. In truth, the bank fraud agent stated that I was the victim of an \" account takeover '' and that they had a suspect named \" XXXX ''. Secondly, the statement that \" XXXX XXXX had no additional questions or concerns '' is a blatant lie -- I do still have a major concern -- getting these fraudulent charges credited back to me. As a result of Bank of America 's incompetence, my credit score has dropped 24 points. This is ridiculous, and if the bank does not resolve this, I will have no other choice than to sue the bank to recover these funds. Update -- on XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America responded by offering Monetary Relief in the amount of {$2200.00}. However, I NEVER RECEIVED A CHECK IN ANY AMOUNT!",
