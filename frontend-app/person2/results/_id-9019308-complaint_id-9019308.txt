This date and amount is not in dispute. \nThe next day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I went and had the same procedure but on my XXXX XXXX. The cost of this was also {$1800.00}. I used CareCredit on this transaction as well. On Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX I received a phone call from the physicians office saying that the CareCredit from XX/XX/XXXX had, in fact, not gone through and that they would like me to use a different form of payment. I used My XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  for {$1800.00} and that transaction went through immediately. I thought that all was well until I received my statement from CareCredit saying I owed XXXX rather than {$1800.00}. I called immediately and after a very long time waiting got through to a person that said that they had thought it was a fraud so they froze my account. Later, during the same call, the CareCredit representative said that I had frozen in the account. Not true. At that time, I began a dispute. I have since contacted the physicians office repeatedly, and they have shown me definitively that they had not received the money from CareCredit for XX/XX/XXXX. Synchrony bank/CareCredit declined my dispute. I have since reopened a dispute. \nIn summary, I continue to owe CareCredit {$1800.00} for my XXXX XXXX. My XXXX XXXX was paid for ( and now paid off ) by my XXXX XXXX card. In addition, my balance continues to show that I owe {$3700.00} without giving credit to the XXXX payments Ive already made. I agreed to pay {$3700.00}, not {$5500.00}. If they are doing this to me, how many others are they doing it to and arent fighting it.?? \nAlso, notice that theyve sent me a notice for late payment in the same screen that shows auto payment is on!",
