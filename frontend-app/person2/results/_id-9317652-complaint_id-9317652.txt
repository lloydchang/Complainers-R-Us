I logged on to my Wells Fargo account and downloaded the XXXX statement and saw a note in tiny font in the middle of the page that my promotional period was up. I immediately paid the remainder of the balance, minus the interest. My husband called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX to try and resolve this issue as their email did not provide proper notification of the promotional period expiration and they refused to negotiate or reduce this egregious XXXX XXXX interest, because I didn't pay it by XX/XX/XXXX. This is predatory lending at its worst. If you sign up for electronic communication, any urgent notices should be clearly stated in the email.",
