I did apply and was approved for {$1500.00} but my flights were {$1800.00} or more. I continued to purchase my flights with an additional credit card, thinking that the additional credit card would only cover the amount over the {$1500.00} limit. That didnt happen. The full amount went on my XXXX. I called Citibank, A representative told me that I would receive my card in the mail and When I started using the card I would receive the promotional amount. After using the card for several months I called Citibank again and ask them why I had not received the {$250.00} promotion. I was then told by a representative that I needed to wait until the end of XXXX ( When the promotion ended ) to receive the {$250.00} credit. I called Citibank in XX/XX/XXXX and said that I still have not received the credit and was told that I was not entitled to the credit because my flights were not purchased on the Citibank advantage card. I told them that I had called several times before and was told to wait until the end of the promotion. They said I dont know who gave you that information but now that the promotion was over, that there was nothing they could do about it. I called again the next day to see if a different representative would give me different information because that is what had happened in the past, but they also said that the promotion was over and that there was nothing they could do to assist me. \nI believe that this was deceptive advertising, very poor customer service and that the customer service representatives did not give me a correct information between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I do not trust this company and will not believe their promotional offers in the future.",
