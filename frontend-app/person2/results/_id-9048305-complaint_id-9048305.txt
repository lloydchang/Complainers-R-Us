Below, I provide a detailed account of the events leading up to this complaint. \n\nOn XX/XX/2024, I initiated a balance transfer of {$700.00} from my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card to my Capital One credit card, taking advantage of Capital Ones 12-month zero transfer balance offer. While the {$700.00} debt was promptly posted to my Capital One account within five days, the balance on my XXXX XXXX account remained unchanged. \n\nI contacted both Capital One and XXXX XXXX several times over the next few weeks. Initially, I was informed by Capital One that the transfer process might take up to two weeks. After three weeks passed with no change, I was advised to wait another week. Despite following these instructions, the balance on my XXXX XXXX account was still not adjusted. \n\nIn early XXXX, I learned from Capital One that a check had allegedly been sent to XXXX XXXX at the address XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, California, XXXX. XXXX XXXX, however, stated that they never received the check and could not investigate the matter without a copy of the check. \n\nCapital One representatives assured me they would send a copy of the check to my address so that I could provide it to XXXX XXXX for investigation. They promised the check copy would arrive within 10 to 15 business days. However, three weeks passed with no communication or delivery from Capital One. When I followed up, I was informed that the check had not yet been sent but would be sent immediately. The representative I spoke with was dismissive and ended the call abruptly. \n\nI have now been dealing with this issue for nearly two months. I am still required to make payments on my XXXX XXXX credit card for a debt that should have been transferred, and the ongoing delays and lack of communication from Capital One are causing significant financial strain and stress. \n\nI am requesting the CFPB 's assistance in resolving this matter. Specifically, I seek the following actions from Capital One : 1. **Immediate Investigation** : Conduct an urgent investigation to determine why the balance transfer has not been completed and why the check was not received by XXXX XXXX XXXX \n2. **Proof of Payment** : Provide a copy of the check or any proof of payment sent to XXXX XXXX as soon as possible. \n3. **Reimbursement and Compensation** : Reimburse me for any additional interest or fees incurred due to this delay and compensate for the inconvenience and financial hardship caused by their handling of this situation. \n\nI appreciate your attention to this urgent matter and look forward to your assistance in achieving a swift resolution.",
