  "complaint_what_happened": "On XX/XX/year>, I made a payment to my Prosper credit card online, as I have always done. The payment exceeded the minimum amount due, and the due date was XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/year>, I noticed that the payment had not cleared my bank account. Upon checking my online account, it indicated that the payment was processed on XX/XX/XXXX and that my account was in good standing. \n\nI contacted Prosper customer service and spoke with representative XXXX. ( Note : All calls are recorded for quality assurance and training purposes. ) XXXX informed me that the payment was returned on XX/XX/year>. When I inquired about the reason, she stated she did not know. I also asked why I was not informed of this, to which she replied that it was not their responsibility. She further stated that I would be charged a returned check fee and a late payment fee. When I expressed my dissatisfaction, she abruptly ended the call. \n\nI called back and spoke with another representative, XXXX, who informed me that my account was now restricted due to the returned payment and that nothing could be done until I made another payment from a different bank account. Unfortunately, I do not have another bank account. When I asked again why the payment was returned, she said she did not know and that they could not find out. She then ended the call. \n\nI contacted my bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX, which recently took over XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/year>. After spending two hours investigating, my bank determined that Prosper, either through their software or manual processing, omitted the first XXXX zeros of my account number, rendering the account unidentifiable and causing the payment to be returned. \n\nI contacted Prosper again and spoke with representative XXXX, requesting to speak with a manager. She transferred me to a supervisor named XXXX. I explained the situation and my bank 's findings. I made another payment online that same day. XXXX stated that it is their policy to restrict accounts and charge fees regardless of fault. He mentioned he would submit a ticket for investigation but that the fees and restriction would remain. The ticket number is XXXX XXXX \n\nOn XX/XX/year>, I received an email from Prosper stating that they had conducted an investigation and confirmed the payment was returned without providing a reason. They maintained the restrictions and fees, closing the case. I responded, pointing out that my payment was not late until XX/XX/XXXX, so no late fees should apply. The payment was returned due to Prosper 's error in processing my account number. Despite this, they are penalizing me with fees and restrictions. \n\nIn response, Prosper reiterated that the restrictions and fees would remain and closed the case. I informed them that I would be filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Representative XXXX then indicated that if I did so, they would close my account and demand immediate full payment of the balance. This response appears to be retaliatory for reporting and refusing to accept responsibility for their actions.",
