On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a {$2000.00} payment on my credit card that was at {$2800.00} ( at the limit ). A couple days later on XX/XX/XXXX they sent out my statement and at the same time a letter saying that they are reducing my limit down from {$2800.00} to {$960.00}. Which was left me just under {$30.00} of available credit, after making this {$2000.00} payment. In using this card for years and under the expectation I would have that credit line available to me, it is extremely damaging to my finances to completely unexpectedly lower my credit limit. On top of this, they stated it was based on a credit report that was pulled in XX/XX/XXXX ( over three months ago ). I'm not sure why they would do this, as I've been a loyal and timely customer, gainfully employed, they have maken plenty of interest off of my account no problem with me paying. It is a shock, as I'm trying to reduce my overall credit utilization across my cards, that now this card is basically reporting 100 % credit utilization, when it should have been down to 25ish % based on the credit line and how much I paid. I called them today on XX/XX/XXXX and they say they regularly do this every 3 months and I could ask for a credit line increase, so I asked to be restored to my original and never changed credit line of {$2800.00}, which they declined on the phone. Furthermore, when I called on XX/XX/XXXX to make the payment, there was nothing said about any review of my credit line or creditworthiness or anything like that. Ideally I would want the credit line restored back to normal, though I really don't want to pay another XXXX to this company. But I fear that if I pay it and close it out, it will further hurt my credit as a closed account. Please help with this matter.",
