Fraudulent charges appeared on my account on XX/XX/XXXX. I opened a fraud report with Truist fraud department that same day, Truist case number XXXX. Since then, Truist has failed to investigate the fraudulent activity. My monthly statement does not show a dispute or fraud claim was made. They have now added interest and late charges on top of the charges I did not make. Yesterday XX/XX/XXXX I was called by Truist 's collection department. Despite telling the agent that the charges were in a fraud complaint, the agent continued to demand I pay the balance. I believe Truist is attempting to defraud me by pressuring me into paying something I do not owe. They should never have allowed the fraudulent charges to post to my account in the first place.",
