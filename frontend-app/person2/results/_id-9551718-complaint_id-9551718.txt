I just received a notice that they have updated their policy that they will be charging to receive paper statements as of next month. The fee is {$1.00}. Although the size of the fee is small, it is a fee which punishes consumers for managing their finances. \n\nFor those that don't review statements religiously it could be easily missed. Otherwise it essentially is nudging if not forcing customers to use online statements only. Computer ownership is common nowadays however this policy is essentially requiring people that want to use their store credit card to own a computer and have internet. Should a customer want a paper copy for their records they would also need to own a printer. \n\nHowever my largest concern and my personal issue with this is this new policy forces a customer to manage finances online. Companies have IT departments that are constantly working to keep themselves safe but there is no way to guarantee security. I don't have an IT department on my end. I can not explain how a computer works or how the internet works or how a hacker works, etc. I do know that anything online is exposed to risk. Literally a few minutes ago I received a message that my data was compromised from another company I have business with. Some hacker got info from millions of their customers in the blink of an eye. I have had a bank that had a computer glitch and it erased a deposit made months before. They had no record it was ever received. I had my bank statements they sent me. Because of that they found the computer error and also multiple other customers affected.

One thing that is and always has been the truth is people that manage their finances online are much less likely to actually review statements. They are lazy. This is not an opinion but a financial truth that online users are much more likely just to check the balance and never review a statements item by item. People from older generations learned how to balance a checkbook and reconcile their accounts with their statements.
