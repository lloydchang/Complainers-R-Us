They allege they notified me of the charge via email and have been billing me since. I did not recieve a notification, and since they allege it was apart of the agreement and essentially is their version of an annual fee but monthly ( {$60.00} ). I did not dispute it and since i did not catch it earlier I figured it was my oversight. \n\nSo, XX/XX/2024 a new card arrived and i went to activate it and noticed the fee has increased from {$5.00} to {$7.00}, along with the already high increase rate which is not clearly labeled on the statement any where. I call and they used the same line, we emailed you of the changes. Which was not the question I asked. I stated i never received any notification in writing regarding the changes. I also restated my question. Why were the fees increased on my account? I confirmed there were no late payments, the payments were above the minimum, etc. The representative stated that i could opt out of the increase which i promptly indicated i wished to opt out of the increase. He then states by opting it essentially closes my account. I explained wanted to opt out of the increase. He transfered me to another rep who stated she was advised i wanted to close my account for which i corrected and stated I wish to opt out of the increase in fees and charges. She places me back on hold and transfers me to anotherassociate. \n\nI asked if the call was being recorded at which time she could no longer speak to me because i said the call was being recorded. I countered with you all are not listening i asked if you all were recording the call. Her response then was they were not.
