I did so and they asked for further information including my account number, birthdate, mother 's maiden name, and social security number which I supplied. Then they asked for a copy of my driver 's license or passport which made me suspicious so I logged off and called the credit card number on the back of my credit card who said they hadn't sent an email suspending my account, however I had already given the information including my social security number to the scammers. I immediately changed the password on my Visa account and placed a temporary hold on the account. \nHere is the email I got from the scammers including at the end a copy of the details from the sender : Potential unusual activity on your account We saw some activity on your account that didn't match your usual activity.
