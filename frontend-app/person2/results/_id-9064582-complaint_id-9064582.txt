  "complaint_what_happened": "The Apple Card keeps charging my account for a charge from XXXX saying they side with XXXX XXXX although I have proof from XXXX XXXX that they believe my account was hacked and do not find me responsible for the charge. \n\nHere is my back and forth with Apple Card in XX/XX/XXXX. I also called them by telephone in XX/XX/XXXX and I am beconing frstrated with them because they say the investigators are from Goldman Sachs and not their offices, yet they can not provide me with the information to speak to these investigators myself.\n\nFirst and foremost, I already submitted a copy of the email from XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX numerous times to the Apple Card which explained that that they are not holding me responsible for the fraudulent purchase on my account on XX/XX/XXXX for an event that was taking place on XX/XX/XXXX across the country so this should have been closed in my favor already. \n\nLets review the letter that was sent to me from Apple Card multiple times since I've had to dispute this charge multiple times. \n\nPAGE 2 MERCHANT RESPONSE PAGE 2 is pretty much blank, so it doesn't look like any type of dispute response.\n\nThis would coincide with my phone call to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX in which they said that my Apple Card closed the dispute in their favor without a response from them. \n\nThe only thing marked with an \" X '' is XXXX - Documentation to prove cardholder in possession of and/or using merchandise. \nHow can I use the merchandise if the event was held on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX closed my account for my safety a month prior on XX/XX/XXXX? \n\nIn BOLD on PAGE 2 it states ... ( 2 or more options must be selected ) and it seems nothing was selected by the merchant although your document used the word must.\n\nThe rest of PAGE 2 basically has XXXX  responses. \n\nPAGE 4 COMPELLING EVIDENCE PAGE 4 of the document you sent me is illegible and any reasonable person looking at it would have to agree. I even took a picture and zoomed in and it is still illegible mainly because it's pretty much entirely black. It's pretty embarrassing on your part that this would even be sent out to me in this condition.\n\nSo basically to me, the COMPELLING EVIDENCE PROVES NOTHING because I can't see what it is. \n\nPAGE 5 I really don't understand what PAGE 5 is but it marks the date of purchase time as XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX Hours. \n\nBy XXXX Hours which is XXXX XXXX for me, I had already contacted my Apple Card hours before about the fraudulent purchase and even had a new card number well before then. I also contacted XXXX well before this time, so I'm disputing that this is even correct information on this report. \n\nIt says the device information is a cell phone, but what location was this phone in at the time of purchase and how do i find out the ip address of my phone? \n\nPAGE 7 XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX the only thing missing is the date of the event which was 4 weeks later on XX/XX/XXXX and the fact that I live in New York and haven't traveled to California since XXXX. \n\nAs far as my address, email. etc ... of course XXXX XXXX will have this information because I had an account with them probably going back over a decade. Again the purchase time is 2-3 hours AFTER I reported this to Apple and it's not evidence if an alleged scammer first hacked my account in XXXX. It just means someone was on my account without my permission or authority without my knowledge, permission and/or authority I would like you to provide me with the location of the cell tower where these purchases were made, because I know where i was all day on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nPAGE 8 Of course XXXX XXXX had my card info, it was stored on their site for years. this does not mean I went on the site to purchase these tickets as anyone who hacked my account could have went on. If they look later in the day, after I became aware of the fraud, I went on their site to dispute it. Hackers have the ability to manipulate someone's IP address. \n\nCLOSING STATEMENT I never bought tickets for a XXXX game nor did i ever have in possession tickets for a XXXX game on XX/XX/XXXX in XXXX XXXX. I notified my Apple Card and XXXX XXXX more than 4 weeks prior to this event that these tickets were allegedly purchased for. That is more than enough time for XXXX to take action to void it. In addition, XXXX XXXX closed my account on XX/XX/XXXX for my safety and sent me an email saying that I am not responsible for the charges. This is an open and shut case, and I'm not happy that I'm here spending my time defending myself for this over 2 months later.",
