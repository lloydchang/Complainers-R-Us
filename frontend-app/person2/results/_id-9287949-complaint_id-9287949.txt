On [ Date of Incident ], I experienced the unfortunate loss of both my credit card and mobile phone at the XXXX airport. This loss resulted in my being locked out of my XXXX XXXX online portal and unable to access or manage my account. \n\nMoreover, due to the reported loss/theft of my wallet and phone, I was compelled to cancel my previous billing information associated with auto-pay settings. This further complicated my ability to make timely payments through automated means. \n\nDespite these challenges, I maintained communication with XXXX XXXX while abroad. However, upon returning to my residence at XXXX XXXX XXXX, I discovered that all my mail and packages had been compromised. Notably, my neighbor, who collaborates with the homicide division across XXXX XXXX, did not capture any clear footage of the entry points to my home. \n\nAs a result of these extraordinary circumstances, I faced considerable difficulty in regaining access to my account, managing my payments, and securing my personal information. Nevertheless, I was able to make a payment of {$52.00} on XX/XX/year>, which was within the expected timeframe. This payment reflects my commitment to maintaining a positive payment history with XXXX XXXX, as evidenced by the 67 % on-time payment rate. \n\nTherefore, I respectfully request that XXXX XXXX conduct a thorough review of this matter and reconsider the reported XXXX late payment status on my credit report to accurately reflect the extenuating circumstances I faced during this period. I appreciate your understanding and prompt attention to this dispute. \n\nPlease provide written confirmation of the investigation 's findings and any corrective actions taken to rectify this issue.
