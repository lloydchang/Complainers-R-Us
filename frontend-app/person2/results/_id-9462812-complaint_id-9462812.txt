They are still insisting that they never cashed the check. So now i am paying the balance transfer off and never got credited from XXXX, and out {$1800.00} plus interest. I feel that Barclays is actually stealing the money from me. I just got off the phone with Barclays and they are playing dumb. This is very frustrating. I hope that you can get my money back, plus interest. \n\nThanks, XXXX XXXX",
