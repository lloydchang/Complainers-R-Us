Previously, in the correspondence to your one of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I stated I did not recognize the card ending XXXX. I can clearly say I do not have that card of your company, XXXX XXXX, since it is incongruent to continue to use the card offered by the company, which despises the customer who paid off every month and criticized continuously that I claim the reward certificates after using them ; even though I just could not use the certificates amounted total {$70.00}. When I complained and asked to close the account, my account was closed and the bank itself announced its account was closed. Maybe your company states that the amount of {$470.00} was transferred to the account ending XXXX. And you can say your company did not mail the credit card since the banking account of XXXX was closed itself just after the payment. Anyway, I need to state I have never requested your company to transfer the balance because I have decided to pay off as usual and the relationship with your company would be terminated completely. \nThere is the incongruity of correspondences of your companies, XXXX  office in XXXX XXXX, Florida refers my card ending numbers XXXX on XX/XX/year> ; even though, still, on the review on CFPB on XX/XX/year>, the senior XXXX, XXXX XXXX uses both addresses in XXXX, UT and XXXX XXXX, FL. This office in Florida sent XXXX large envelops which contained the CFPB review copies. The office in XXXX UT sent an email, which related with unfunctional and partially disappeared XXXX rewards website account, to tell me the payment was processed by referring the account number ending XXXX. I already complained this matter. The office related with XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, PA has sent XXXX large envelops which had the copies of statement for account ending XXXX ; even though I never asked it to send it. I believe this confusion might be occurred due to the communication difficulties of several offices of XXXX. Even they might have had the miscommunication by some reasons, they have caused the confusion by issuing unknown credit card and stating the existence of this card ending XXXX even there might be the danger of fraud then. \nAnother concern is this statement for unknown card ending XXXX has the history of credits to PAYPAL XXXX XXXX CA twice, {$130.00} on XX/XX/year> and {$91.00} on XX/XX/year>. I can state same amounts were refunded from this XXXX to my PayPal account ; therefore, this transaction history is dubious. Also, I need the explanation what is the refund check of {$220.00} on XX/XX/year>. I insist I have the right to receive the explanation from your company since this suspicious statement is related to me and my residing address. \nFrom the notice received XXXX office, addressed XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, PA XXXX, my account, whichever ending XXXX or XXXX, was closed on XX/XX/year>. Therefore, I just can say your company office correspondences have much confusion and need to clarify the matter when XXXX was closed, and when XXXX was opened and closed ; otherwise, the impression of suspicious activities can not wipe out. So, I believe your company offices need to work together and clarify the questionable matters, and if necessary, just wipe out the unnecessary office ( XXXX ) which cause the confusion and delay, since in this modern world, all correspondence should be done in one second.\n\nAnyway, I want to make sure there is no card with your company by receiving the correspondence in accord as one business cooperation. \nSincerely,",
