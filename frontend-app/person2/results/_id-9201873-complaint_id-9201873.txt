This time, the balance was high, because I am doing a construction renovation in my home. So I paid the {$9000.00} balance off on XX/XX/XXXX. The money has left my checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. I called in XX/XX/XXXX to see why they hadn't applied the payment yet and they said they were holding it until XX/XX/XXXX. That is XXXX weeks where they have my cash AND are holding my credit. That does not seem right or fair and they can not provide terms that I signed that said they would do that. They are penalizing me for paying!! Outrageous. And if they can hold my money for 14 days, shouldn't they owe me interest??? If I was 2 weeks late on my payment I am sure I would have to pay interest. Why do they get to lock me up like this? My contractor is waiting for his next payment!!",
