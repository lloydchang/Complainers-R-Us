  "complaint_what_happened": "My spouse submitted a balance transfer request through her creditor XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) on XX/XX/year>. She received notification on XX/XX/year> that the balance transfer payment was received and the check cashed on XX/XX/year>. That payment was never applied to my credit card balance. What we have gathered is that the payment was submitted through XXXX XXXX who still had old financial institution information for my creditor. I used to have an account through Barclay 's, but they sold my account to XXXX XXXX. Therefore, the payment from XXXX was sent to Barclay 's instead of to XXXX. I reached out to Barclay 's in XXXX, but since they no longer have my account- as it was sold to XXXX- they had no way of looking me up to determine if they received a payment for my account. They also had no idea who to transfer me to and suggested I reach out to XXXX. I did reach out to XXXX and on XX/XX/year>, they notified me that they have no record of the payment that XXXX XXXX sent in XXXX. I submitted a copy of the cashed check to XXXX for them to look into further. On XX/XX/year>, they notified me that they have received the documentation and were researching my claim. On XX/XX/year>, I received a final letter from XXXX stating that they \" found that this payment was cashed by the previous lender of your XXXX Extra Points Visa account. We ask that you please contact the previous lender for any questions regarding this payment. '' We have already tried to contact the other lender ( Barclay 's ), but they have told us that there is nothing they can do because there's no way to look me up in their system. I have verifiable proof that Barclay 's received my money, as they cashed the check, but they don't know where the money is or how to get me to a department that does know. Now that this money has been lost, my wife is paying for the balance transfer on her card while I am still paying for the \" balance '' on my original card. By submitting this balance transfer, we doubled our debt, and Barclay 's effectively stole {$8900.00} from us.",
