  "complaint_what_happened": "This complaint is about Barclays XXXX XXXX and the JetBlue Plus credit card. \nThe problem began because I had virtually no income from XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX due to the XXXX XXXX hacking. I work as a rXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and payments from insurance companies comprise most of my income from this position. Insurance did not pay for almost 2 months due to the XXXX XXXX hacking and I received payments of 10 % of my earnings or less from my job from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ( I can demonstrate this with bank statements if necessary ). \n\nUntil XX/XX/XXXX, my maximum monthly payment had been {$210.00} and I sometimes paid more, like my last payment of {$230.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I acknowledge that this payment was late and that's because, like I said, I had not gotten paid since XXXX. I called Barclays to let them know I was going to have problems making my payment due to the XXXX XXXX hack and all they said was that they hadn't heard of it and they hoped I could make my payment in time. \n\nInstead of helping me, in XX/XX/XXXX they doubled my minimum payment to over {$440.00}. \nThe same month they lowered my credit limit from XXXX to XXXX. My credit card usage was at XXXX so what I understand from this is that they did it on purpose to make sure I would go over my limit. \n\nI was not able to pay the {$440.00} and I became late on my payment. Now, on XX/XX/XXXX, my monthly payment is up to {$820.00} and I can not afford that either. \n\nBarclays keeps sending me emails saying to log in to their site to set up a payment plan but then when I log in it says Im not eligible ( see screenshots ). \n\nIt is my understanding that Barclays has acted unfairly by lowering my credit limit when they saw I was close to it and simultaneously doubling my monthly payment. \n\nWhat I want from them is for them to give me the fair chance to set up a payment plan at my previous payment of {$250.00} or less. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX the Barclays Document Center no longer shows the letter where they lowered my credit limit. Looks like they erased it so I wouldnt be able to access it any longer.",
