It also had a referral offer of XXXX points on up to {$25000.00} spent over the next 3 months at restaurants. \n\nI was spending on my cards to ensure I hit the required spend for the sign up bonus. \n\nI connected both cards to my personal XXXX checking account in order to pay the statement balance. I had sufficient funds in my account to cover both statements. \n\nXXXX : - XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a payment of {$1000.00} on the XXXX XXXX XXXX account. \n- XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a payment of {$5500.00} on the XXXX XXXX account. The statement due date was XX/XX/XXXX. \n- XX/XX/XXXX I received an email saying that my payment on the XXXX XXXX XXXX was unable to be completed and it had been returned by my bank. \n- XX/XX/XXXX ( same day ) I called in and spoke with a customer service agent. who updated my account number and reprocessed the payment. The payment was also updated in my account. \n- XX/XX/XXXX I received an email that my XXXX XXXX payment was unable to be completed and had been returned. \n- XX/XX/XXXX ( same day ) I called to fix the issue. The customer service agent told me that we needed to wait for the payment to settle before reprocessing. They also notified me that there would not be any issue as the statement close date was XX/XX/XXXX and they put a note in my account indicating that to future representatives so that i would not be penalized. \n- XX/XX/XXXX I received a missed call from amex and an email stating that all of my accounts with amex had been closed due to returned payments from the checking account. This includes the personal XXXX  card that I have had with amex since XX/XX/XXXX. \n- XX/XX/XXXX I called to try to reactivate my cards but multiple customer representatives told me there was no way to reactivate the cards and the only option was to apply for new cards even if this would impact my XXXX XXXX and I would lose my sign up bonuses. \n\nI understand that the bank account number might have been mistyped. However this was a simple human error. I was proactive in attempting to fix the issue and followed all directions by Amex customer representatives. I also submitted correct payments before the statement due dates and in no way was trying to commit fraud. \n\nI have several concerns with these actions taken by American Express : - American express closed all of my cards, including my preexisting personal card - This action has impacted my XXXX XXXX by closing my existing credit - Amex did not allow me any time or ability to fix the issue and took drastic action without even speaking with me. \n- Amex customer representatives assured me that i was in the clear and never said anything like this could happen. \n- Amex confiscated my existing points balances for all three of my cards with amex. I had over XXXX Amex points and XXXX XXXX points - I am also unsure if Amex has blacklisted me for no fault of my own for any future cards or banking relationship with Amex even though i have been a customer with them for over XXXX years. \n- I am also frustrated as American express has a once in a lifetime rule for card bonuses, so even if i follow the recommendation of the agents, i would not be eligible for a new sign up bonus for the credit cards that I opened. \n\nI have already made the payments for my statement balance and additionally have a XXXX dollar balance on all my cards. \n\nOverall, I am very disappointed with American Express 's customer service. I did not receive proper notice when any of these actions were taken. I also asked to speak to a supervisor when I called on XXXX but still have not received a callback or any meaningful action from Amex leading me to file this complaint. \n\nAt this point I can not recommend American Express products to anyone if they treat customers this way after making a basic human error of not entering a bank account number correctly.",
