They have 4 reward categories ( 4 %, 3 %, 2 %, 1 % ) for different types of purchases ( gas, restaurants, costco, etc ), however, you can not see how any of your purchases align with the rewards as there is only a lump sum earned for each month visible to the customer. Unlike my XXXX card which itemizes and display the earnings, I find this to be a significant concern so I contacted Citibank to ask for an detailed report to show how the rewards were being accumulated.

I don't understand why they are not able to show how they arrived at the reward values and am concerned about the transparency of this rewards program.",
