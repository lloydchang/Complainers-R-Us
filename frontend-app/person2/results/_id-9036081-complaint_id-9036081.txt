Today ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I called Commenity and asked what I am past due for and they claim I owe {$30.00} in late fees, plus interest on the late fee, and then another {$30.00} for this month late fee ( which is a late fee for the late fee ). \n\nComenity Bank explained that I will continue to incur {$30.00} every month in late fees + interest until I pay off the balance. The balance is strictly fees and interestnot charges for items purchased. I have not been late with payments since I opened the card and have paid off balances of all charges. I do not feel it is right that I am continuing to be charged late fees every month. I asked if the fees could be waived and I did not understand how I could be charged interest on only a late fee or how I could be charged another {$30.00} in late fees monthly, given all payments for charges have been made. On XX/XX/XXXX, I asked Comenity Bank to close my card/account and they said they did but they did not. After the calI, I received no email or verification that the account was closed. I called back later on XX/XX/XXXX and asked them to close my account again and was told the account was active and not closed. I asked for the account to be closed because I do not feel it is right to be continuously charged an additional {$30.00} a month and interest in late fees on late fees. I was able to receive verbal confirmation that the account was closed but have not received anything in writing that the account has been closed. Comenity told me that I would be taken to collections and even though the account was closed, I will continue to be charged fees on late fees and interest. I dont understand how my charges can be paid off in full and yet I am continuing to receive compounding monthly late fees and interest? This doesnt seem right.",
