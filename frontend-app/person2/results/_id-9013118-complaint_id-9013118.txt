  "complaint_what_happened": "From XXXX XXXX, 2024 to XXXX XXXX, 2024 I rented a car from XXXX XXXX. The initial cost was {$540.00} which included {$200.00} deposit for XXXX XXXX, 2024 to XXXX XXXX, 2024. I extended the car rental at weekly rates from XXXX XXXX, 2024 to XXXX XXXX, 2024. Each extension required a pending charge on my American Express card ( see image XXXX for example ) at the point of extension. This meant that the available balance on my Amex account included these pending charges. Thus at the end of the rental, I was not expecting another charge on my credit card for the full amount of the car rental for the month for {$940.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, I rented a car from a different company, XXXX which authorized a weekly rate and deposit of {$300.00} for a total of {$640.00} on the same Amex account. However that charge isnt posted on my account as pending despite it being XXXX days since that transaction occurred. There was enough funds ( {$770.00} which should have reflected the pending charges for the XXXX car rental from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX plus {$130.00} pending charge for returning it on XX/XX/XXXX ) in my account to cover the XXXX transaction on XX/XX/XXXX, however my current available balance is XXXX. Its been very difficult to get a true account of my balance and spending limit. The major purchases on my card are for the car rentals. Its concerning that the business practices of charging pending transactions that fall off before the full payment has been ongoing for the over the past XXXX years. This practice makes it difficult to accurately calculate the balance on my credit card account and how much of my monthly payments in addition to biweekly payments are going towards keeping the balances manageable. Ive sent complaints about similar issues to Amex in the past and it continues.",
