  "complaint_what_happened": "I have been trying to settle some late fees from my Sunoco Credit Card, that I believe were charged erroneously and unfairly. I have been a cardholder for many years and have paid my bills regularly and stayed in good standing. Recently my wife and I changed our payment method from sending checks in the mail to paying online, through our bank XXXX XXXX. When I pay my bills online through our bank, the bank and company we are paying process the bill in 1 business day. Sunoco takes at least 7 business days, sometimes longer. I have paid my bills electronically before the due date, but because of the long processing time ( only experienced with Sunoco 's Credit Card ) makes them receive the payment late, and I get charged a late fee ( exorbitant -- starting at {$29.00} ). I have called Sunoco ( and Citi, who handles the payments, I understand ) to dispute this, saying that I have paid for the goods and services ( in this case, gasoline ) on time and am arguing the fairness of charging a late fee to a customer who is paying them before the due date, and their processing time is making the payment late. I am now receiving bills charging late fees on top of the original late fee, even though I have called them numerous times, and spoken to supervisors. The recent bill, dated XX/XX/XXXX, is now up to {$110.00}, which is all late fees. I have paid Sunoco for all the gas we have consumed. In the process of speaking with them on the phone on XX/XX/XXXX, I asked for our Sunoco Card Account to be cancelled, as we prefer not to do business with a company that is punitive, unreasonable, and delinquent in processing payments in a timely manner. The ID number of the gentleman I last spoke with about this matter on XX/XX/XXXX is # XXXX. I wanted to lodge a complaint and a dispute about the recurring late fees on top of late fees, but he would not agree to do that. I am now receiving threatening letters ( sent on XX/XX/XXXX ) from Citi Cards about my debt to Sunoco. The XXXX bill was paid on XX/XX/XXXX and processed on XX/XX/XXXX",
