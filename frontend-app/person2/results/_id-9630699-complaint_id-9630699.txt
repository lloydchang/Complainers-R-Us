I was never told to do anything. The charges were aligned with the other bank issues where someone spent more than {$2000.00} in XXXX. I dont live in XXXX and I dont work there and I have not been there in years ; especially since COVID. \nI heard nothing from anyone until XXXX, well over 30 days and 90! I only knew about it because they sent me a late payment letter. \nI never missed one payment on my Citibank card or Best Buy which again was paid off going into the year. \nI was told that I didnt get cleared by someone in their fraud department because I didnt file a police report. \nI did so immediately but they said even if I did it immediately there wasnt much they could do. \nI sent forms to Best Buy/Citi stating that the day of the transaction was the same day as I started a new job and that I was not in XXXX that day. They claimed that they called me and I approved the transactions. It was a laptop and headphones. My company provided me a laptop so I dont know why I would go to XXXX to buy a laptop the first day of my new job! And I also sent my phone records for the day and I didnt see any calls. Even if they did theres still a probability that I didnt get it or ignored it or any number of reasons like rushing another junk call off the phone. I would not have approved if I knew.",
