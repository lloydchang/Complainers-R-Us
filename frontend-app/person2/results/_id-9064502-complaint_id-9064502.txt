She said she saw me on the camera. I told her to show me the footage since I know I did not break any oil.\n\nShe then said one of her worker saw me. I said that's not true I did not break any oil.\n\nI continued shopping, then went to check out at the cashier register. At the register I gave all the items in my cart to the cashier ( the manager was next to cashier ). the cashier cashed all the items including the bottle of oil which was for {$39.00}. ( see receipt # 1 ). She gave me all the items except for the oil. I asked her several times for the oil, the manager said I paid for the oil. I said where is the oil I paid for she refused to give it to me. I then paid again for a bottle of oil which was given to me.\n\nI told her I did not break the oil and I will report it to my bank because she charged me for {$39.00} for a bottle of oil which was not given to me.\n\nI reported this matter to capital one ( Claim XXXX # XXXX ) and disputed the XXXX on the receipt # XXXX. I requested that the vendor show proof/evidence, the camera footage showing that I broke the bottle of oil.\n\nCapital one told me that they have investigated it and refused my claim for the refund {$39.00}.\n\nCapital one further told me that I will have to show them evidence that I did not break the oil or that he Oil was not given to me.\n\nAttached are the vendor document submitted to capital one and the email from capital refuting my claim.\n\nThank you for you serious investigation of this matter since in my opinion there was no investigation conducted by capital one. the vendor did not submit any evidence to substantiate her claim, yet capital one sided with the vendor.",
