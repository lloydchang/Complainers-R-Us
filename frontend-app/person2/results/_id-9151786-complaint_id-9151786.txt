  "complaint_what_happened": "I received a credit monitoring alert on XX/XX/XXXX about an inquiry from XXXX XXXX XXXX Synchrony Bank. I didn't apply for any credit, so I called Synchrony to inform them of the fraud. They closed the account and initiated an investigation. There was already a fraud alert on my credit, but as it didn't prevent this account from being opened, I also placed a credit freeze with XXXX, XXXX, & XXXX. I also noticed there was a phone number on my XXXX credit report, which didn't belong to me, so I submitted a dispute to have it removed. \nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received another credit alert that a new account with XXXX XXXX XXXX had been opened with a balance of {$4800.00}. Again, I called Synchrony because this account should have been closed 3 days prior. The fraud customer service person told me it was open still, but she closed the account and started an investigation. \nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter confirming the fraud investigation was concluded and I would not be responsible for the charges. \nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received another letter saying they were unable to approve my claim ( despite the above resolution ). I called the fraud dept & was informed they received a sales receipt from the merchant where the billing address matched the shipping address. I reiterated I didn't open this credit card and did not purchase any goods, so they reopened the fraud investigation. \nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter about this credit card, but the last 4 digits of the account were different. I called the fraud dept. who informed me the credit card account had been reactivated- which I did not request. Again explaining I'm a victim of identity theft, they closed the credit card account. \nI received a fraud investigation form in the mail, where I gave a brief statement. I faxed this form, as well as a copy of my police report, to the specified number on XXXX. \nOn XXXX, I received a physical credit card in the mail ( I was never mailed one previously ). I called Synchrony fraud AGAIN to ask why as I never opened this account and have repeatedly closed it. The representative informed me my fraud claim was denied XX/XX/XXXX, though I never received a letter stating this. I explained I submitted the investigation form, which she couldn't see in my file. Since they hadn't looked at my evidence, she reopened the investigation. I also requested that this credit card be closed yet again. \nOn XXXX, I mailed the identitytheft.gov letter requesting all records relating to this account and included a copy of my drivers license, police report, and FTC complaint. I also requested a copy of all records to be sent to the XXXX XXXX Police Department. \nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received a claim rejection letter stating authorized, participated in, or benefited from the purchase and the credit card was activated from a phone number belonging to me ( the latter was not marked on the first denial ). \n\nI did not attach any documents as I've already mailed copies to the Synchrony Fraud Investigations department.",
