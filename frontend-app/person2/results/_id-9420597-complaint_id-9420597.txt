The purchase was made with an online vendor I have never used before in my XXXX  years as a Bank of America customer, in an amount of money grossly outside of my usual travel budget, for services that I clearly did not utilize - based on documents submitted to BofA by the vendor themselves. This was an obvious case of fraud based on the fact the purchases used a clearly suspicious email address that has no association with me, and the room which was purchased through this vendor was used by someone of a different name. Further, Bank of America initially gave me a refund in the amount of the fraudulent charge and sent me a new credit card to replace the compromised account, making me think the issue was resolved. Bank of America never informed me via phone or other means that the investigation was ongoing or that I should submit further evidence to corroborate the fraud. I did not know that my claim was denied until the {$3500.00} was re-charged to my account over a month later on XX/XX/year>. I had to speak with three different service representatives before I could get the fraud claim re-opened, and I still await resolution of the issue.",
