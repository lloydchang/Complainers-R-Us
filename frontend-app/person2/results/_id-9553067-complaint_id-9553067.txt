I have stopped using there card XXXX months ago and have been trying to pay the card off and noticed that my account was never going down, but going higher or stays the same. I contacted Citi on XX/XX/year> and the customer service rep expressed how the only way to stop the interest was to pay the complete balance. I believe that's ludicris. I pay more on my bill than the minimum, but due to them continuously adding this anormous amount of interest even after I had them discontinue the service. There is no way I will be able to pay what my balance is at this point. I will actually be paying them XXXX what I owe them and I will never be able to pay the card off. I believe Citi is doing bad business and I missed last months payment because of the interest that I've been charged lately. I have been oweing {$3000.00} dollars after every payment and that is not being consumer friendly at all. I will pay my payments when they stop the interest charges and take off what has accumulated in the last XXXX months.",
