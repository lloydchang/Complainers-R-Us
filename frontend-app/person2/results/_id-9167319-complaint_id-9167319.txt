Of course I logged into the app to see what fraud transactions were made so that I can call them to dispute it. And of course the chip was used my card was lost and used in what it looks like NY & NJ which i DO NOT live. Now there is a balance {$580.00} & im not paying a cent of it because I did not make these charges. Also at the time I called in on XXXX there were only a XXXX charge pending and then today theres now another XXXX charges that were never pending or posted to my account. I challenged SELF on this because how did you guys not see these other charges as if they approved them to go through even after locking and replacing my card! I have provided a screenshot showing that I stayed no to the charge and they still allowed multiple Other fraud charges to go through! Now they are stating that I am responsible for these charges when I didnt make any of them.",
