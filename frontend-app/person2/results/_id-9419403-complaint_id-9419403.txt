I call USAA to inquire about this and initially the customer services reps can not tell me why this charge is back as there has been no letter or report from the fraud department. Several days later I do receive a message from the fraud department simply saying that my fraud claim has been denied and that I am responsible for the {$6200.00}! \nThey have given me no reasons for the outcome of their investigation and no other information for their findings. I can not even make contact with them. I have called and asked for an explanation on multiple occasions but will not be put through with anyone in the fraud department. I have asked the service reps what information they need to help them believe me and they have no answer for me. \nThey do not seek the truth of the matter. They don't want it to be fraud. They only want to deny and delay and hope that I will go away. \nI have been a customer of USAA for XXXX  years and the one time that I need them to believe me that I have been a victim of credit card fraud, they have basically called me a liar. \nThey have this whole facade of being an organization that helps military and veterans.
