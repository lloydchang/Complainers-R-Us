  "complaint_what_happened": "I have a AAdavantage Aviator Red Mastercard with Barclays. On my XXXX XXXX XXXX billing statement, I was charged {$41.00} for interest. Per the statement, my previous balance as of XXXX was {$1900.00}, Per the statement, I made payments of $ {$1800.00} leaving a balance of {$100.00}. As a result, I was charged interest of {$41.00} which is approximately 37.97 %. This is significantly higher than the credit card terms.\n\nOn my XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card statement, I was charged {$47.00} for interest. Per the statement, my previous balance was {$3600.00}. Per the statement, I made payments of {$6500.00} or {$2900.00} MORE than the outstanding balance but, was still charged interest. \n\nIn speaking with the Barclays representative, I was informed that interest begins accruing as soon as I make a payment. Specifically, since I make small payments multiple times up until the Due Date, interest began accruing as soon a s I made a small payment towards the outstanding balance. Based on the explanation which I confirmed with the representative, as an example, if I had a balance of {$10000.00} and I made a payment of {$5.00} immediately upon receiving the statement, interest would begin accruing on the remaining {$9900.00} even though I still have 22 days left before the due date. This clearly does not make any sense. \n\nBased on the representative 's explanation, if I make a payment on the first day of the 22 days prior to the due date, interest begins accruing on that day regardless of whether or not I've paid a significant portion of the balance before the due date.. However, if I wait until the actual due date, interest does not begin acrrueing until that date. \n\nSo, based on the explanation, my XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/year> statement continued to accrue interest despite the fact that I paid {$2900.00} more than the balance. \n\nThere are clearly issues with the method in which Barclays is charging interest to customers. As stated above, a {$100.00} balance was charged {$41.00} in interest and the following month, I was charged {$47.00} interest even though the entire balance and more was paid.",
