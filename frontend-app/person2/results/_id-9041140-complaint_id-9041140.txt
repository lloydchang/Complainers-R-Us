  "complaint_what_happened": "All I know is that I had a positive balance of {$720.00} and now my account is XXXX without any transactions. \n\nHere is the emails I sent to Chime with no response. I have the ticket numbers for every single call reference as well as everything stated is true I was lied to XXXX times and hung up on XXXX times in a period of XXXX hours by Asians and supervisors to no avail. They kept passing me back-and-forth from the member services to the dispute team both claim and they have no knowledge of how these charges happened. \n\n\nI had a positive balance of {$320.00} in my account as of today XX/XX/2024, approximately XXXX I got off of work to go get gas and my account said that my balance was - {$320.00}. I did not have any notifications or did not authorize any transaction upon calling Chime. I learned that it was an adjustment, but there is no claim to represent that I had disputed {$320.00} with XXXX ATM that did not disperse any funds. You guys denied the initial dispute and then you filed an approximately XXXX I got off of work to go get gas and my account said that my balance was - {$320.00}. I did not have any notifications or did not authorize any transaction upon calling Chime. I learned that it was a adjustment, but there is no claim to represent that I had disputed {$320.00} with XXXX ATM that did not disperse any funds. You guys denied the initial dispute and then you filed a charge back after I provided the police report, the chargeback was granted yesterday on XX/XX/2024 for the two transactions for {$320.00} each totaling {$640.00}. It is clear that this {$640.00} was taken back from my account making it - {$320.00} I was hung up on by an agent named XXXX at XXXX XXXX  on today then I was hung up on by an agent named XXXX at XXXX XXXX  today. Then I spoke to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ticket number XXXX at XXXX XXXX, who then honored my request to speak to a supervisor, I was transferred to supervisor XXXX to number XXXX. I spoke with XXXX for over an hour. He listened to the previous phone calls and was extending his apologies for being hung up on so many times, and the most terrible way. After doing some investigating on my account, XXXX informed me that he thinks that the merchants at the store are scamming me and have some sort of card copier, which I had not even heard of. We both agree that none of these transactions made sense given the fact that so much money was taken out of my account without any notification before or after and you guys at Chime could not decide who actually initiated this. The Disputes team says it was a adjustment so it had to be member services and member services said it is related to a claim so it had to be disputed, I was hung up on again by the supervisor XXXX, who assured me with his word, and who seems so genuine, even mentioning prayer please please please refer back to that phone call ticket number XXXX and give me the actual time and energy that I deserve as a valued member, who direct deposit his whole entire check to you guys just to be insulted and hung up on. And that would explain pretty much everything and detail but basically XXXX assured me that he would be speaking to a supervisor from the Disputes team and trying to get my funds credited. That was my rent money my children my XXXX daughters and I are now outside we were evicted, today was my last day to pay and I had the money. This is not some XXXX story. This is the gods honest truth. While I was on hold for XXXX minutes. Thinking that XXXX was a standup person. He disconnected the call as well as he assured me he wouldnt multiple times and he also lied about submitting my complaints against the agents nor did he leave accurate notes. I talk to an agent, XXXX, XXXX who again did not listen to anything that I said or take me seriously, and she, too hung up on me. My last attempt was with an agent named XXXX. XXXX. She didnt even read the entire thing before she just assured me that my issue was something that she couldnt help me with this. I found out that the card has also been used at the same ATM for {$400.00} to which I am not even able to have done because look at my phone location I was at work.! and the card is with me!!! The fact that you guys could take that much money out of my account and make it negative without even a notification on my phone or that merchants can just come into my account and just take money without you defending it and possibly the worst that your agents have disrespected me, cursed me out and hung up in my face and still get their checks from providing service to me. I dont know if this email will fall on deaf, ears or not but I just wanted to let you know that you guys have done it again you defeated me a good man. I took my children to the police station because I no longer take care of them and I am really contemplating taking my life. Its over I dont want the money I cant deal with this anymore. Im just at a loss for words. if you give any shit at all, I would just suggest to listen to that service request number from XXXX. The initial was to the representative but she transferred me to XXXX around XXXX XXXX from that time. Please have the decency to listen to that, and you will understand why I want to kill myself. I still dont even I had a positive balance of {$320.00} in my account as of today XX/XX/2024, approximately XXXX I got off of work to go get gas and my account said that my balance was - {$320.00}.
