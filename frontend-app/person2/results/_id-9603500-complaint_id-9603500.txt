The bill provided seemingly conflicting information as broken out in the bullet points above and I did not understand why only part of a single purchase was subject to interest. The original representative was unable to answer my question and provided conflicting information that I had a special promotion that made only part of the balance subject to interest but also telling me that I needed to pay in full to avoid interest ( approx. XXXX min ). After escalating to a supervisor, I was on the phone with them for XXXX min before they were finally able to provide the answer that this was the average daily balance during the prior bill cycle. In all, the call totaled XXXX minutes to find an answer that should have been disclosed in the statement. If it took their trained representatives that long to be able to figure out why the bill displayed this information, I'm not sure how I, as a consumer, am supposed to be able to understand my bill.",
