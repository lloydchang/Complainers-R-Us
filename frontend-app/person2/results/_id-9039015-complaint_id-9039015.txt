  "complaint_what_happened": "On XX/XX/XXXX I looked up a telephone number for XXXX XXXX  customer service to get tech support to fix my XXXX XXXX  watch. I called the phone number that I found for this company. I had no idea that the people that I reached on the phone were not XXXX XXXX but scammers and they were generating a video call on their end without my knowledge. I later found this out by calling the phone number back and saw myself on video. I never made a video call to this number. I never gave them passwords, credit card numbers or gift card numbers. They stole them from my phone which they had unauthorized access to. I was scammed out of over {$1500.00}. in gift cards which they charged on my Target.XXXX credit card. When I realized that what they were doing was not helping me fix my watch I hung up the phone and did some investigating and realized that it was a video call on their end and that I had been scammed. I later wiped my phone clean and changed all my passwords and checked all my credit cards for purchases. I called Target XXXX XXXX. XXXX ext. XXXX and reported the fraud. They closed my account and sent me a fraud questionnaire which I faxed back to them on XX/XX/XXXX. I received a bill from Target on XX/XX/XXXX for {$1500.00} so I called the XXXX XXXX. and they told me that I was responsible for the paying the bill and they claimed that a letter of resolution was sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX. I never received this letter and I asked that another letter of resolution be re-mailed to me. I still have not received that letter 6 months later. I was told by the supervisor to send another letter of appeal and the claim would be re-opened. I sent another letter to the fraud dept. on XX/XX/XXXX and have not received a letter of resolution as of XX/XX/XXXX, 90 days later. Every month when I received another bill from them I call the fraud dept. asking to speak to a supervisor and each time I was told that the letter of resolution on XX/XX/XXXX would be resent and they would have someone call me back in XXXX hours. No one has ever called me from Target fraud dept. I have documented XXXX phone calls where each supervisor I spoke with would only share their first name with me and every time I called they told me the same thing, someone would call me back in XXXX hours and they would resend that first letter of resolution that they claimed was mailed to me on XX/XX/XXXX. Upon checking my credit report I could see that I now have an unpaid balance of {$1800.00} for Target. I have always had excellent credit and this is not right that they reported this unpaid balance and have never given me a letter of resolution about why I am responsible for this bill. I faxed them another letter on XX/XX/XXXX that they need to make a decision and send me a letter of resolution.",
