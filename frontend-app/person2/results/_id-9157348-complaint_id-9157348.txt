I had to go in on XX/XX/XXXX, and find out that my couches were finally in and they called me later that day to schedule delivery.

I came home from work to discover I had received the WRONG couches. I went to the store at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. The store sales man said the manager would get back with me the next day but never did. I was told the manager was out of town and would not be back for a week. I never received a call from the manager.i filed a dispute after 3 straight days to get ahold of a manager to no avail. I still have the couches because I have no way of getting the couches back to the store or the manpower to lift and move the couches back out to a truck to take them back. Sychrony bank has closed the dispute without ever contacting me about the problem with the couches. I sent pictures to show that the couches are not power recline couches. I receive a letter from Sychrony bank that my dispute was denied because XXXX XXXX says they delivered the correct couches but never corrected the issue. The manager refused to talk to me about it before or since the incident started. It is now XX/XX/XXXX, and allni want is these 2 couches to be gone and the money back on my credit card so I can go somewhere else to get my couches.i will NEVER deal with either company again.",
