Its XXXX XXXX of the matter with me, I was unaware of the fee, I paid my balance and said I dont use cards with fees and lets part ways. I closed the account. Is this how a major company should be treating people? This is the lengths they are going to now and theyre hurting consumers. I have had a pretty decent XXXX XXXX for years by being careful. My score has been XXXX for years, now XXXX down to XXXX because they are sending me a bill every month with interest which is now up to {$XXXX}. This scandalous company comes along and wants to take me down over {$XXXX}. Im holding my ground!! They are ruining my credit and I want it to stop. They are making it look like Im delinquent on my bills on my credit report.",
