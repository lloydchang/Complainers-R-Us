The only reason I decided to sign up to try this card was because of the travel statement and miles. \n\nThe terms of the offer clearly stated \" If instantly authorized, credit card members will receive temporary account information and a temporary minimum credit limit. This temporary account information can be used during payment for the current eligible American Airlines purchases at time of checkout to receive the statement credit. '' I was instantly authorized but was provided no confirmation number or account number. There was an option to click to receive the temporary account information which I clicked on and received a confirmation code by text message. I entered this code and then was back on the main page. There was a little green check mark next to the temporary account information received but I never got an account number within the window, by email, by text message, or within any popup window. I tried selecting the green check mark and the boxes but no luck. There was absolutely no way to access the temporary account information. When I tried to go back to the previous page with the option to send the code by text message, I was logged out. I could not log back in using the account username and password that I just created. \n\nI called the Citi phone number for general customer service and eventually was able to reach a representative, XXXX. I told the representative what happened and the representative said that they do not have access to the accounts and if I did not get account information at the time I signed up, I would have to wait for the card in the mail. Obviously, this meant I would not get the {$400.00} travel statement on my current purchase and, since I was not planning on traveling again within the 6 months required in the terms, I would not be getting the {$400.00} statement period. \n\nI told the representative that I would like to cancel the card. The representative said that I would have to wait until the card came in the mail to cancel. I stated that this felt like a scam and asked to be transferred to someone to make a complaint. The representative stated that there wasn't a complaint department or anyone that I could be transferred to but took my name and phone number to try to find someone. I have yet to hear back from anyone to cancel the application or the card or address the false advertising. I have screen shots of the offer as well as the terms for the {$400.00} statement credit.",
