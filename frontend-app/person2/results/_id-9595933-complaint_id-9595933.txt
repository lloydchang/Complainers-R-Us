  "complaint_what_happened": "Yesterday, XX/XX/2024 I discovered my credit card was not in my wallet. I just used it an hour earlier so I have a very good idea where I lost it. On calling the business they said they had not found my card. So I proceeded to call the number on the back of my wifes card ( XXXX ) to report the card lost or stolen. I have visa card from XXXX issued by CITI bank. \n\nWhen I called the number the person who answered said they were going to send me a {$100.00} reward. I thought this was strange, but maybe it had something to do with my XXXX XXXX XXXX on the XXXX  XXXX. I gave her my name and address, She wanted to know my email address. I started getting suspecious and asked if I could report the card missing. She continued to request information. I refused to give it and demanded to report the card missing. I was concerned that someone could be using the card at that very moment. Finally she admitted that I was not talking to CITI bank or to XXXX and gave me a number to call to report the card missing. When I called that number ( XXXX ) it was still not CITI bank or XXXX. I had to use my phone to search for the correct number. \nWhen I reached a representative to report the card missing I told the representative about the misleading and incorrect phone number on the back of the card. The representative did not know a thing about it. I asked her to report the problem to the management and to fix it. \nWhen I received an email from XXXX XXXX stating I had a hold on my card I followed the link \" Contact Us '' XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX & XXXX & XXXX & XXXX % XXXX % XXXX % XXXX % XXXX % XXXX % XXXX % XXXX % XXXX % XXXX % XXXX % XXXX & XXXX XXXX XXXX ) in an attempt to inform them of the problem with the phone number on the credit card but the link led to a blank page. \nWhat bothers me the most about this situation was the deception in the phone number and the possibility of me giving out all sorts of personal information to an agent thinking that I was talking to a trusted business, namely XXXX or CITI, I called what was supposed to be a TRUSTED NUMBER on my credit card! It was actually a phishing scam. \n\nI want XXXX and CITI bank to send a notice out to everyone who has a credt card notifying them that the phone number on the back of the card is wrong and not to be trusted or used to report a stolen or missing card and they should provide the correct number. \nFurthermore they should be required to inform the cardholder every time that VERY IMPROTENT AND VITAL NUMBER is changed so there will be no confusion in the future about who you are talking to!!!",
