I have a balance over {$3000.00} so I went from using approximately 30 % of my credit limit to now over 95 % of my limit. This has devastating impacts on my credit score. It dropped XXXX points. Now I have never had any late payments or issues with this company. I also have not missed payments on any of my other cards. But due to the fact i have used my other cards they decided it would be a great idea to decrease my limit by {$8500.00}! I understand decreasing a limit but decreasing it by that amount is not fair. I am now harmed due to this lower credit score on obtaining additional credit. There should be a policy in place for reducing credit lines for customers with no issues. This practice is awful!",
