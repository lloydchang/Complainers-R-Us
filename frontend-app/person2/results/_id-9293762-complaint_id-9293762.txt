I called US Bank and was told they made no corrections on the phone andwould look into it and I would receive a letter in the mail. I received nothing. I called a second time and they said I had an option on my application and I didn't check the correct option to receive the no interest. I'm not sure why there would be an option to pay basically 20 % but I didn't argue with the rep. She told me they woud wipe all the interest with a {$400.00} deduction. By this time my interest was an additional {$220.00}, totalling XXXX. They told me they would wipe all interest but only wiped out {$400.00}. They also told me the could not see an offer with 18 months no interest. I believe both were untruths.",
