She indicated that she or someone from SEVENTH AVENUE would call if I was approved for credit and before anything is shipped out to me. The next thing I know is that I have a package from them ... I called and asked who authorized this to be shipped ... I thought that I cancelled the order and was to receive a call first. Anyway, I wasn't going to pay to ship it back plus insurance ... No No No I think she asked me to use it and told me that it would not work for long..it would just suddenly stop charging but I would receive a full refund. So, I used it ... checking email mostly not too many things... so I email and call and I have to send the computer back... I asked them about the personal and business information on the computer ... how would that be handled ... they would be responsible for any problems or issues that resulted in theft or break ins to my accounts utilized on the computer during shipping and beyond if my information was not erased completely.
