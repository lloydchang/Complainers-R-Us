No one contacted me. \nXXXX XXXX indicated that the issue was reopned when it shouldn't have been closed! \nXXXX - XXXXGS - sent him pics via text message. Issue was closed. \nCalled on Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX when I rec 'd a bill for {$180.00} but I asked for the entire amount to be refunded. To date, NO RESOLUTION has been made. No one texted me back.
