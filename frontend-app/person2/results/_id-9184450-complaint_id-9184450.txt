On XX/XX/year>, I mailed XXXX of their balance transfer checks to XXXX XXXX to payoff a {$630.00} balance. On XX/XX/XXXX, Chase posted the cleared check and charged my credit card {$630.00}. Around the same time, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX saying they received my check for {$630.00}, but couldnt find an account in my name. Thats because I dont have any accounts with XXXX XXXX I can only assume our terrible U.S. postal service misdirected the letter addressed and mailed to XXXX XXXX. The letter from XXXX included a copy of the front and back of the Chase balance transfer check, clearly showing the payee as XXXX XXXX. XXXX has refused to help and directed me to Chase. I called Chase on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX and was told, at first ( twice ) they would investigate and send me a letter in 7-10 days, which they never did. In XXXX, I was told a stop payment was attempted unsuccessfully in XXXX, which is not surprising since the check had cleared with Chase on XX/XX/XXXX. In XXXX, Chase refused to help and transferred me to someone at XXXX, who said I needed to talk to Chase.",
