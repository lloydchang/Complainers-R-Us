It shall be unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under this chapter.\n\nI exercised my RIGHT to credit in good faith and I did not expect my application to be denied. This decision not only adversely affects me but also, I believe, constitutes a violation of federal laws in place to protect applicants like myself. In accordance with 15 U.S. Code 1691 ( d ) adverse action defined ( 6 ), the term adverse action does not include a refusal to extend additional credit under an existing credit arrangement where such additional credit would exceed a previously established credit limit. So I can not be denied credit simply from adverse action.\n\nIn accordance with 15 U.S. Code 1602 ( f ), the term credit means the RIGHT granted by a creditor to a debtor to incur debt and defer its payment. I, XXXX XXXX, do not need to defer any payments but I did exercise my right to incur debt. Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1691a ( b ), the term applicant means any person who applies to a creditor indirectly by use of an existing credit plan for an amount exceeding a previously established credit limit.\n\nYou might be wondering what is this credit plan? Well, it's defined in 15 U.S. Code 1602 ( j ) : A credit plan or open-end consumer credit plan which is an open-end credit plan or open-end consumer credit plan within the meaning of the preceding sentence is an open-end credit plan. So for something to be open-ended, it simply means unlimited. I have the lawful right to extend credit unlimitedly to incur debt so long as I operate at peace as well as in good faith. \n\nI, XXXX XXXX, am more than able, capable, and willing to pay back any credit extended to me. I only applied for this credit card to start a new financial relationship with Barclays Card Services. No other company could fit my needs from what I've researched, and I thank you for taking my application as well as this letter into consideration when someone takes a second look at my application. \n\nIn accordance with 12 CFR Part 1002 - Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( Regulation B ), Regulation B protects applicants from discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. Credit transactions and aspects of credit transactions include, but are not limited to, consumer credit, business credit, open-end credit, credit applications, standards of creditworthiness, denial of credit, revocation, or termination of credit.\n\nIn accordance with 15 U.S. Code 1642 - Issuance of credit cards, no credit card shall be issued except in response to a request or application therefor. I made a request and no fiduciary obligation was upheld by Barclays Card Services.\n\nI will only accept your offer to deny me credit on the condition that Barclays Card Services or any representative admits that they obtained my information from a consumer reporting agency and will not issue myself the credit for a reason outside of adverse action. The response letter must be signed under penalty of perjury and must be notarized. Also, admit to being in violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681q - Obtaining information under false pretenses : Any person who knowingly and willfully obtains information on a consumer from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses shall be fined under title 18, imprisoned for not more than 2 years, or both, as well as 18 U.S. Code 1951 - Interference with commerce : Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce by extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.\n\nSo as you can see, some pretty hefty fines. Or Barclays Card Services can choose to act in my best interest and issue the credit card to me, as I definitely need this in order to buy cleaning supplies and vinyl flooring for my house as well as a camera to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX \n\nI expect Barclays Card Services to address these concerns in compliance with the relevant legal standards and take immediate corrective actions where necessary. I look forward to your prompt and detailed response to this matter. You can reach me by phone to verify who I am at XXXX or by mail. \n\n**Application ID : XXXX Sincerely, XXXX XXXX",
