They can not explain to me why my promotional balance of {$330.00} exceeds the initial purchase amount of {$300.00} on my XXXX statement. I was told that my payment of {$50.00} on XX/XX/2024 was applied to this promotion. If the {$50.00} payment was applied to this promotion expiring on XXXX my balance would be {$250.00} but online it shows as {$280.00}. I am confused and they asked me to call back again. This feels very deceitful they are now moving money around to cover up their error. If I wouldn't have noticed this, I would have ended up paying more money. Please help me.",
