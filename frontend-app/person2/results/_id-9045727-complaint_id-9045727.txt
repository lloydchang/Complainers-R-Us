I followed all the terms and conditions and made sure the purchase qualified. There was nothing excluding me from receiving cash back. The item I purchased was a \" Buy it Now '' item, and it met all of the terms and conditions for the offer, and did not have any conditions to exclude it. \n\nI'm a coin and bullion collector, and regularly buy items on XXXX and take advantage of the Capital One Offers l when they have elevated offers. Previously, I have never had an issue. Unlike prior times, however, there was a serious issue this time. Notwithstanding, I document every step of the way ( via screenshots ) to make sure I have proof that I followed directions. \n\nI purchased the coin on XX/XX/year>, paid for the item, and had the item delivered to me on XXXXXX/XX/year>. The item was never canceled. ( Please see the XXXX summary showing that I purchased the item on XX/XX/XXXX, and it was delivered on XX/XX/XXXX ). \n\nOn XX/XX/year>, I checked the Shopping Trips portal on Capital One Portal, and I saw that my purchase was listed with the correct trip number, the total order amount ( {$2400.00} ), and the status as \" pending. '' It included the date and time of my purchase. Similar to prior purchases, everything was accurate. I took a screenshot. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>, I received an e-mail from Capital One that CONFIRMED I would be receiving 4 % cash back, and it should show up as a credit in XXXX billing cycles. Again, this was consistent with prior experiences. When an item qualifies, it shows up on the \" Shopping Trip '' portal within a day or XXXX as \" pending '' and then you receive an e-mail confirmation from XXXX XXXX. Up to this point, I had no issues. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>, the XXXX item was delivered to me ( see attached ). \n\nOn XX/XX/year>, I checked my Capital One account and noticed that the item no longer showed as \" XXXX, '' but it now showed \" Canceled. '' This was very odd because I didn't cancel or return the item, and Capital One 's Rewards Statuses expressly indicate that an item can only be Canceled when the order was \" either canceled or returned in full. '' None of those happened here. \n\nThat same day, I immediately called Capital One and spent over an hour with a customer representative, and then had the matter escalated to a supervisor ( EEID # XXXX ). During the call, I inquired why the item was listed as \" canceled, '' as I had not returned the item. They could not provide me a reason and simply said the item was showing as \" canceled '' in the system. We went through line by line every aspect of the terms and conditions and confirmed that none of the exclusions applied. I respectfully requested that I receive the credit of {$96.00} within XXXX billing cycles as required ( i.e., {$2400.00} x XXXX = {$96.00} ). I also offered to provide them with all of the evidence including the screenshots of the purchases, the e-mail confirmation from Capital One that I will be receiving the 4 %, and the XXXX invoice confirming that the item was delivered and not canceled, and they refused. They said it's against \" their protocol '' and that because they can't confirm the reason for the cancellation, there's nothing they can do. \n\nThis is deeply problematic for a myriad of reasons. Capital One refused to accept documents and evidence that none of the exclusions applied to prevent me from receiving the 4 % cash back/credit. They refused to accept their VERY OWN e-mail which confirmed the item qualified for 4 % cash back/credit, and that I would receive it in XXXX billing cycles. They also refused to accept my documentation from XXXX that I never canceled or returned the item. \n\nYet, when I asked what the reason for the cancellation was they could not tell me and cited their \" protocols '' without providing a specific basis why I can't provide evidence of the transaction. The escalation supervisor was condescending, sarcastic, and rude, and did not try in good faith to assist with the issue. The original representative was wonderful, but she regretfully could not assist with the situation. \n\nSuch conduct is fraudulent, illusory, and is clear evidence of false advertising. Capital One did not offer me the opportunity or due process to substantiate that I completed the transaction and am entitled to the 4 % cashback.",
