I requested the check verification from my bank and once again notified Best Buy Citibank in writing through the consumer portal that this was their operational error as the bank verified that Check No : XXXX was processed, deposited and cleared by XXXX Citibank US NA. \n\nDue to operationally inefficiencies Citibanks consumer portal does not allow for consumers to send in real time documentation related to an issue or provide physical documentation via upload. You will see thirty-three ( 33 ) written notifications from myself, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX, where I am asking for Citibank to investigate the situation, allow for me to provide the documented proof ( that I had to get for them since they couldnt find my payment they already deposited and had not applied to my account ). \n\nThey responded to fax them or send it in the mail seriously in XXXX and knowing the back-end technology of XXXX - Citibank is making and/or creating obstacles for consumers to resolve issues and with written documentation this is against the fair credit reporting act as they should have been escalated this operational issue with the written proof the payment was made and corrected immediately. \n\nInstead, they reported me as being late to all three credit reporting agencies impacting both my credit scores as well as they decreased my line of credit due to their operating error. \n\nFor the record I provided them with these details in writing since they did not provide a consumer portal digital upload option to support operational errors/omission escalations for their consumers : Check Date : XXXX Check No. : XXXX Check Amt : {$500.00} Citibank deposited this check on : XXXX ( as clearly stated on the back of the check ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( code after date ) XXXX Citibank US NA XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, Citibank send me a letter via this same consumer portal for my Citibank Best Buy card that they found my {$500.00} payment from XX/XX/XXXX and since applied it to my account. It shows up in the XXXX statement with a date of XX/XX/XXXX, processing date even though it took 90+ days for this company to find the payment. \n\nUpon this notification I was concerned this was a systemic issue with the processing of payment and performed my own audit to find just that scenario. You will find in my extensive documentation that Citibank knew this was an issue there are four ( 4 ) separate scenarios where they have lost my payment and then applied it at a later date to my account. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX Payment was made on XXXX Amount {$400.00} Citibank charged me erroneously for a late fee and have yet to reverse it after they found the payment on XX/XX/XXXX and applied it to my account ( you will see this in the statement for XXXX ) and then back dated the lost payment to XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Payment was made on XXXX Amount {$100.00} Citibank charges me a fee of {$1.00} this month ( not sure for what as I am on an interest free promotion ) XX/XX/XXXX, Citibank finds the lost payment that has already been deposited per my bank and then applies it to my account and back dates it to XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX Payment was made on XXXX Amount {$300.00} Citibank charged me a {$29.00} late fee that has yet to be reversed THIS PAYMENT IS STILL NOT POSTED TO MY ACCOUNT It has now been 5.5 months since this payment was paid, withdrawn from my account, deposited by Citibank and yet not posted to my account XX/XX/XXXX Payment was made on XXXX Amount {$500.00} Citibank charged me for various fees and have not fully reversed these as you will see in my full audit of this systemic issue with Citibank Best Buy payment processing Although this situation is what has shed light that there is a larger issue at Citibank, I still have a missing/lost {$300.00} payment that Citibank has not applied to my account from XXXX, and it took three months for Citibank to find the lost/missing payment from XXXX. \n\nI need this very serious issue corrected as this has been a continuation for over 90 days that has impacted me personally through false reporting to three separate consumer reporting agencies. \n\nActions requested immediately and expeditiously by Citibank : 1.
