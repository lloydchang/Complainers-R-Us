  "complaint_what_happened": "I am filing a complaint regarding my Bank of America credit card account. Despite managing my account responsibly by maintaining a low or XXXX balance and never missing a payment, Bank of America suddenly reduced my credit limit from {$5000.00} to {$1500.00} without prior notice or valid explanation. Subsequently, they closed my account without consulting me, citing inactivity as the reason when I contacted customer service. This action was taken without warning or an opportunity for me to address the inactivity. The unexpected reduction in credit limit and account closure has severely impacted my credit score by reducing my overall available credit and increasing my credit utilization ratio. I contacted Bank of America on [ Insert Date ], but their response did not address my concerns adequately. I am seeking assistance from the CFPB to have my credit limit reinstated to {$5000.00}, my account reopened, and to receive a clear explanation of Bank of America 's policies on account inactivity to prevent future occurrences of this nature. This incident has caused significant stress and financial difficulty, and I request the CFPB 's help in resolving this matter.",
