I filed the dispute since they charged me for shipping fees... for double the amount that was requested and because part of the order is missing. Comenity automatically just denies all billing dispute, which I think is both unethical and illegal. They're now saying that the merchandise was delivered, so the charge is valid. Again, they charged me double what was agreed upon, and I am missing over {$700.00} of the merchandise. I did NOT get the services that I was charged for, it's as simple as that. Comenity makes it nearly impossible to file billing disputes, I had to file this one three different times. And again, automatically denying these disputes should definately not be allowed.",
