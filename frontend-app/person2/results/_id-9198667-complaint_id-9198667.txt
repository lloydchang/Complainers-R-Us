  "complaint_what_happened": "Description of the Issue : I hired XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  from XXXX for fixing the toilet-clogging/water-backup. A total of XXXX repair attempts ( XXXX ) and the issue kept recurring after 1-2 months from the repair date. The service was not fulfilled as agreed even after 8 months and we had to engage another plumber to fix the issue. First XXXX performed hydrojet for {$600.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ( repair # 1 ). No diagnosis report, no root cause identification, no warranty. The problem returned after a month. XXXX provided 2 options ( 1 ) to replace all pipes under the house with ABS or ( 2 ) install liner inside the pipes under the house and they recommended option 2 ( {$5000.00} ). Installing the liner on XX/XX/XXXX did not resolve the issue ( repair # 2 ). We then asked XXXX to identify the root cause and fix the issue once for all. We told them that they would have to do any additional work if the issue recurred free of cost because then that meant we were paying for unwanted work that's not addressing the root cause. XXXX agreed, and replaced a portion of cast-iron pipe under the house with ABS the same day XX/XX/XXXX for {$400.00} ( repair # 3 ), assuring this would solve the problem once for all and any additional work would be done free of cost. Problem returned in XXXX and XXXX replaced another area under the house with ABS for {$1500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ( repair # 4 ), blowing away all the agreements made on XX/XX/XXXX. They swore this WAS THE ROOT CAUSE and this would solve the problem ONCE FOR ALL. We were frustrated and stressed out, yet gave-in. Problem recurred on XX/XX/XXXX. Minor repair ( 30 min ) made on XX/XX/XXXX by trespassing the property as recorded by the camera ( repair # 5 ). Problem recurred on XX/XX/XXXX. Problem returned within a few days of the minor repair XXXX ( repair # 6 ). The plumber told our tenants to not flush the toilet paper, but put in the trash bin. This was their solution to the problem. By now our tenants who live in that property and we were extremely stressed out. After the 6th attempt, XXXX wanted to replace another section of the pipe with ABS for $ $ XXXX By then we had doubts on XXXX  plumbing skill and work integrity. Water leakage due to the recurring issue caused high levels of mold in the crawl space. At this juncture, my tenants hired XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  recommended by their colleagues who ran camera and diagnosed the problem on XX/XX/XXXX as collapsed cast iron pipe connector under the house that was not linable, and collapsed cast iron pipes that were lined without repairing them causing bumps/misalignment in the liner. As a result, human waste/toilet paper were getting stuck/piling up on those areas and causing clogging/water back-up. XXXX had to rip away the liner and replace the entire pipes directly under the house with ABS on XX/XX/XXXX. Since then, the problem never happened till dated ( 8+ months ). We paid a total of {$7500.00} from Wells Fargo ( WF ) credit card for the faulty service of XXXX. We paid a total of {$4600.00} ( from the same WF card ) for the redo work to XXXX, and another {$3400.00} for mold repair which was a direct result of negligent work of XXXX ( total of {$8000.00} for redo/mold ). Per WF card policy, we are to be protected from faulty service. XXXX warrantied their work to fix the issue but they did not. We disputed the charges directly with WF on XX/XX/XXXX who denied the refund stating we received the service we paid for. We then filed a complaint with XXXX against WF on XX/XX/XXXX, who once again denied the refund. WF did not protect us from a vendor who did not honor the service promised, contrary to their policy. XXXXs letter to XXXX stated that they identified the root cause in the line going to the city and it seems we did not agree to the work and it seems we allowed XXXX to repair the line going to the city. XXXX is now caught red handed on their lies, with their new claim that root cause was in the line going to the city. They fabricated this story because the XXXXs invoice we attached with the complaint ( complaint directly with XXXX and also with WF ) had XXXX items -one for replacing the pipes directly under the house, and another for the line going to the city. We had XXXX repair only the line under the house. We did not repair the line going to the city. We can have anyone verify this with XXXX or via plumbing inspection. It was there in the invoice as an extra item. XXXX thought we had XXXX do both work and hence they fabricated this story to save their face. So now XXXX is exposed right? They wanted another {$6500.00} for repairing the line going to the city which would not have fixed the issue and we would have ended up in much messier legal battle. The issue was not fixed by XXXX. I am attaching the denial letter from WFXXXX  along with all relevant supporting documentation as proof. I attached only XXXX images and they are not very clear. I can provide high quality images of the collapsed cast-iron pipe/connector areas, and video footage of the camera inspection upon request electronically. I humbly request you kindly intervene and help me get back the money in the amount of {$7500.00}. \nThank you very much. \n\n\nAttachments : 1.
