Your organization contacted Barclay and finally after some time they refunded the late fee of {$29.00}. However now, their statement states that if I am late i will be charged {$40.00} for a late fee. I have NEVER been late paying this company. I requested that they lower my interest rate from the exorbitant 29.99 % and XXXX in the Barclay President 's office wrote me a letter stating that they refuse to lower my interest rate. This company gets away this fraudulent activities and your organization does nothing!! I thought you were here to protect consumers? You need to have the FBI and FTC and all other government agencies investigate their activities. Since all of this has happened to me, how many millions of people are they doing the same unscrupulous and unethical and fraudulant acts to as well? Please stop this corporate greed and unethical fraudulant business practices of Barclay.",
