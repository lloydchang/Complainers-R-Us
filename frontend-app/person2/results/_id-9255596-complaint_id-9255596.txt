Several weeks later, I received two letters stating that my claim each for {$370.00} ( Total {$740.00} ) was denied because the merchant ( XXXX ) provided information that showed the purchases were authorized and that I was responsible for payment. I then contacted XXXX and found out that someone opened an account with them under my name and email address. It appears that whoever did this, picked up the equipment and XXXX did not check IDs to verify it was me. After reviewing my email I do recall seeing the emails from XXXX, but I thought they were fishing emails. However, as soon as I saw the changes on my account I contacted USAA. I have since contacted XXXX to alert them that the account opened under my name is fraudulent and also contacted the three credit bureaus and reported the matter to the FTC. I am a long-standing customer of USAA with an impeccable credit history.",
