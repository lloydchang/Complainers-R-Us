I was then informed that a majority of the {$3200.00} payments I made over the last XXXX weeks was being applied to the offer that expired at in XXXX  because in the fine print of the credit card statement it states the any payment amount over the minimum balance will be applied to the promontional offer with the highest interest rate.
