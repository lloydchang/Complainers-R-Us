I have shown that this contention is incorrect. I did not purchase this item from XXXX and it was never delivered to me. Accordingly, Apple Card/Goldman Sachs has no basis to rely upon XXXX assertions of having sufficient evidence of a purchase. \n\nThe original charge is fraudulent. Apple Card/Goldman Sachs should simply admit that someone breached their security and used my card to make a purchase without my authorization. I have asked them to close this dispute and remove the charge of {$2300.00} from my account immediately. \n\n\nTIMELINE OF EVENTS WITH SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS ( 1 ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to Apple about an unauthorized charge on my Apple card On XX/XX/XXXX, at approximately XXXX, I received a notification on my XXXX via Apple XXXX  about a purchase of {$2300.00} at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Since I did not make this purchase, I immediately contacted Apple by following the prompts to open a dispute for a fraudulent charge through Apple XXXX. The system connected me with XXXX, a Goldman Sachs Specialist with the Apple Card team. \n\nAs you will see, XXXX saw that the transaction was made with my virtual card. Since I mentioned to XXXX that it was an unauthorized transaction, it was evident that she would need to replace my Virtual Card Number. I gave my permission for her to do so. \n\nIn this text conversation, I explained that I suspected fraud because I didnt recognize the transaction with XXXX XXXX a point which I repeated. XXXX stated, I understand that unauthorized transactions can be frustrating. Just know that youre never responsible for unauthorized transactions on Apple Card. \n\nIn this same text conversation, I told XXXX that as soon as I opened my dispute via the Apple XXXX I began receiving thousands of spam emails from various foreign and domestic addresses I did not recognize. I stated that I feared someone had stolen my identity. When I asked XXXX what I should do about the emails, she replied, unfortunately I cant be of much help regarding the emails. I would advised ( sic ) to disregard them. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I called Apple Support about the onslaught of emails I was receiving. I assumed these emails were connected to a fraudulent order made with my Apple XXXX card and that my email address had been stolen. I discussed with Apples agent how someone could have gotten my email address. We also talked about how someone could have gotten my digital Apple Card information and used it to make a fraudulent charge. The agent did not have any advice about my emails, except to delete the spam email, which I did one by one over the next several days. \n\n( XXXX ) I began getting emails from XXXX and XXXX about an order I did not make On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I received an email from XXXX telling me my order was on its way. The email included a picture of a camera. Since this looked like a spam email, I did not open it. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX., I received an email from XXXX saying, XXXX, XXXX XXXX. Your package from XXXX is on its way. Direct Signature Required. '' The email reflected my name and correct home address : in the XXXX line and my home city in the Destination line. This was quite worrisome to me. I feared someone was trying to steal my identity or worse. \n\n( XXXX ) I noticed that the delivery address was changed from my home to a XXXX XXXX. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, I received another email from XXXX indicating a delivery date of Mon, XX/XX/XXXX before XXXX. The email said that a package was out for delivery that day to a neighboring town. I do not live in this town. In the XXXX line, this email still had my home address and the Destination line also had my home city. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, I received yet another email from XXXX. This email informed me that my package was ready for pickup but at a new location : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX. I thought it was odd that the address would be changed. \n\n( XXXX ) I was in Texas on the day this package was delivered and picked up, so I could not have shown the required government-issued ID or sign for the package. \n\n( XXXX ) XXXX did not meet XXXX requirements for delivery of the item. \n\n( a ) XXXX has stated requirements for What to bring to pick up a package What to bring A government-issued photo ID.The shipment 's tracking number ( s ) .The recipient contact information associated with this shipment stated my name and home address. \n\n( b ) I was in XXXX XXXX, Texas from XXXX, so I could not have picked up the item and met the requirements above. \n\n( c ) Someone else picked up the package and pretended they were me. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX., I received an email from XXXX telling me that a package was delivered to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX, on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXXXXXX XXXX. This email incorrectly claimed that it was received by me. Again, this is impossible because I was in Texas on XX/XX/XXXX and did not return home home until XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX telling me that a package was delivered. As I have stated, I never ordered anything from XXXX XXXX and could not have received any items from them. Apparently, someone else bought the item from XXXX website, paid for it with my digital Apple Card, and then had it delivered to a neutral location. They then picked it up without a government issue ID that was supposed to have been presented as a prerequisite for the pickup. \n\n( XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I had a XXXX min phone call with the agent at XXXX XXXX dept ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) The female agent looked up the proof of delivery and stated that XXXX has restrictions on such an item, and they were not abided by by XXXX. The agent went on to explain that XXXX, the account holder, should contact XXXX and put in a claim. She also stated that XXXX can pull this info from the XXXX website since they are the shipping account holder. She then advised me to contact XXXX, give them the physical address the item was shipped to, and have them see for themselves that XXXX did not abide by XXXX stated restrictions. \n\nThe agent also told me that a thief can call XXXX  and change the delivery address. In this case, the person who stole my Apple digital credit card ordered a camera with my card number. I assume that with my card number, they also were able to use my address, which is associated with the card. Then, the day before the camera was to be delivered, they changed the address to a neutral XXXX location. Whoever picked the item up was not able to present the correct identification required by XXXX. The agent admitted that the XXXX clerk did not follow XXXX stated protocol. She said that XXXX, because they hold the account, needs to file a complaint with XXXX, that this is how they can receive their money back. XXXX will then be able to receive their money back, since it is clear that their delivery restrictions were not abided by. \n\nThe XXXX agent ended the call by saying, XXXX works hand in hand with Apple, so this should not be difficult to resolve. \n\n( XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I spent another XXXX minutes on a phone call to Apple I spoke to XXXX and repeated our facts with the new info from XXXX. I was then transferred to XXXX, a supervisor. He informed me that he would contact the dispute team at Goldman Sachs and have them contact me. They did not do so. \n\nXXXX also suggested we call XXXX and let them know what is happening. He intimated that the Goldman Sachs team would ask me if I had done so. \n\n( XXXX ) Immeditately following this call, on XX/XX/XXXX I made a XXXX min phone call to XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) I spoke with XXXX. XXXX looked at the shipping account for the item and noticed the change in location. He said that no one can do this legally. He said that we would hear from XXXX in XXXX or 2 days, perhaps by email. He also stated that this would take XXXX weeks to fully resolve and that he would contact Apple with this info. I received an email from XXXX ( XXXX # XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX ), stating : \" We have provided your case information to our security team for further review. At this time we recommend that you dispute the charges with your financial institution if you have not done so already. '' I have not heard again from XXXX. \n\n\n( XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call from Goldman Sachs I spoke with XXXX, a customer service supervisor. He took notes, especially about the delivery and how XXXX did not follow the protocol set up by XXXX. \n\n( XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice that my Apple Card transaction dispute investigation is complete and the merchant charge would remain on my account Goldman Sachs Bank USA asserts that they have re-investigated the transaction and found that no billing error occurred. Their stated reason is that they have further investigated the dispute and reviewed additional information. Their original decision was to remain because there is no evidence to substantiate the claim. \n\n( XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I began a chat with an agent who reopened the dispute. \n\n\nMy Response to XXXX XXXX On the first page of this rebuttal document, XXXX lays out their rationale. I dispute the following XXXX points : ( XXXX ) Under Customer Information : ( a ) The original purchase was made from an XXXX address in a different county. \n\nI conducted an internet search for the XXXX address XXXX captured at the time of purchase. It seems to be located in a nearby county, in a different town and zip code. Moreover, my laptops XXXX address when I am home is XXXX. This is the same location from which I saw the original notification that an unauthorized charge had been made on my digital Apple card. It is also the same location from which I made my initial contact with Apple as soon as I saw this notification. I was home and at my computer when I saw the fraudulent purchase, not in XXXX XXXX. It bears repeating that I never gave anyone authorization to make any purchase using my digital Apple card. \n\n( XXXX ) See Customer Contact : ( a ) XXXX wrongly asserts that I should have contacted them to cancel what was an unauthorized order. \n\nNo one at Apple suggested I contact XXXX to dispute this unauthorized charge. You can verify this in my communication with XXXX, the first Apple Specialist I texted on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. The focus of my discussions with Apple was on how someone had stolen my digital Apple Credit Card number. I was not even aware I had an account with XXXX, since I have not purchased anything from them in over a decade. \n\n( 3 ) Delivery Information : ( a ) The package was never delivered to the shipping address listed ( my home address ) XXXX  document incorrectly states that the item was delivered to the foregoing address on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. It was instead delivered to a XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX. \n\n( b ) XXXX erroneously asserts that I signed for the package. \n\nThe attachment in XXXX rebuttal package ( see p. XXXX ) states that the package was to be delivered to XXXX XXXX at an address other than my own and that it was signed by me. As I have already stated, I was out of town and could not have signed for this package. \n\n( c ) The manner of this delivery never met the requirements laid out on page XXXX in packet # XXXX of XXXX Terms and Conditions. \n\nPage 8 states that XXXX requires a signature upon delivery. If no one was home, XXXX was supposed to make another attempt the following day. XXXX also states that if they are unable to deliver on the stated day and time, they will send nstructions to the buyer on how to collect their shipment from XXXX 's local hub within a specified time. XXXX was to make XXXX attempts to deliver the package. If they are unable to do so according to their terms and conditions, the package is to be returned to XXXX. I was not in town on the day the package was stated to be delivered. Even if I had been there, I would never have taken delivery of an item I never ordered. \n\n( XXXX ) XXXX has already admitted that XXXX protocol for delivery was not followed by the XXXX agent at their store. \n\n( XXXX ) From the very beginning of this ordeal, I reached out to Apple/Goldman Sachs in good faith. I have reported that I did not make a purchase with XXXX XXXX. I also provided evidence that I did not receive a package from XXXX XXXX. XXXX confirmed that protocol was not followed as to the package pick-up. XXXX has the opportunity to file an appeal with XXXX  and be reimbursed. \n\nConclusion Someone used my digital Apple Card to fraudulently make a purchase at XXXX XXXX. Whoever did this had my name, address, and email. They used this information to make a fraudulent purchase and then arranged for the item to be delivered to their preferred address. XXXX then allowed this thief to pick up the package without following XXXX stated protocol for package pickup. \n\nI never purchased the camera in question. As soon as I learned about it, I contacted Apple Card to dispute the charge. I was never told to contact XXXX XXXX or to cancel an order. I never made an order, so I was not even sure a purchase was really made. Since I immediately received thousands of spam emails, it appeared that someone was trying to steal my identity. \n\nSince I first reported the unauthorized charge on my digital Apple card, Apple/Goldman Sachs has not even attempted to advocate for me. Instead, Apple/Goldman Sachs has closed my dispute on three occasions, incorrectly asserting that the merchant provided sufficient evidence that you made the purchase. This is simply untrue. Not only do they have my prompt report that I did not make a purchase from XXXX XXXX, I have provided proof from XXXX and XXXX that I never received the item in question. \n\nApple/Goldman Sachs has no basis to accept XXXX account over mine regarding a package that was apparently bought and delivered to a person who was not authorized to use my digital Apple card XXXX They have taken XXXX account of what happened as the only pertinent view of the situation, thereby calling me a liar. This is unacceptable, as I am their customer. This eggregious mistake on their part also masks their responsibility to take care of their customer and keep their private information safe. \n\nApple/Goldman Sachs has never acknowledged the real problem here, which is that someone was able to use my digital Apple Card without my knowledge or authorization. Within the past year, there have been well-publicized articles about enormous security breaches regarding Apple-backed data XXXX My information was not safe from a hacker who made a purchase with my information. I will not pay for an unauthorized charge on my digital Apple card. \n\nApple/Goldman Sachs had a legal duty, a legal duty it quite clearly breached, to protect me from a hacker who made a fraudulent purchase using my card number. Although Apple and Goldman Sachs promise that they will keep the accounts of their customers safe, they have failed to do this in my case. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX reported that Apple intends to terminate its collaboration with Goldman Sachs with the next XXXX XXXX XXXX months. I will be severing my relationship with both. I know of no other credit card that would allow such a large transaction ( {$2300.00} ) to be completed without notifying their customer. Apple/Goldman Sachs should have declined such a big purchase or at least asked me to authorize it. I would have declined it and an ordeal that has lasted XXXX  months so far would never have happened. Most credit card companies notify their customers for far less and this helps keep fraud under better control. I am shocked Apple/Goldman Sachs would allow such a charge on my Apple digital card in the first place. Even when I informed them immediately that I had not made this charge, they expect me to pay it in spite of the evidence I have provided that I did not receive the item. \n\nI am Apple/Goldman Sachs ' customer in good standing and with excellent credit. Their conduct is shameful. They also appear unconcerned, since the team doing the investigation has still not talked to me personally about my case and the evidence I have provided. Apple/Goldman Sachs also appear lazy. I have no idea if they ever received the investigative work I have done. I have had to advocate for myself, contacting XXXX and XXXX on my own. I have also reported this identity theft to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and have also filed a police report with the XXXX Police Department.",

better control. i am shocked apple / goldman sachs would allow such a charge on my apple digital card in the first place. even when i informed them immediately that i had not made this charge, they expect me to pay it in spite of the evidence i have provided that i did not receive the item. i am apple / goldman sachs'customer in good standing and with excellent credit. their conduct is shameful. they also appear unconcerned, since the team doing the investigation has still not talked to me personally about my case and the evidence i have provided. apple / goldman sachs also appear lazy. i have no idea if they ever received the investigative work i have done. i have had to advocate for myself, contacting xxxx and xxxx on my own. i have also reported this identity theft to the federal trade commission ( ftc ) and have also filed a police report with the xxxx police department.
