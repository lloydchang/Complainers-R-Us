  "complaint_what_happened": "My credit card credit limit was decreased by the company ( Comenity Bank ). This credit limit was conducted without a prior written \" adverse action notice '' via postage mail or digital message via my online account portal with the company. I have attached a screenshot of my online message center account for confirmation. Before my account was decreased, it was in good standing and I had no past due payments listed on the account. I was paying the account on-time and was not late. The account was not delinquent or in a financially mishandled status. Truthfully speaking, I rarely used the card as you can reference from the last 2 months of credit card statements that I attached. Before my account was decreased, I had an available credit limit of {$810.00}, an account balance of {$1500.00}, the credit limit was {$2600.00}, and I had a minimum payment due of {$58.00}. When Comenity Bank involuntarily decreased my credit limit, it revised my account to reflect as follows : Available Credit : - {$84.00} Account Balance : {$1700.00} Revised Credit Limit : {$1700.00} Minimum Payment Due : {$58.00} According to the CFPB website in reference to credit card companies increasing and decreasing limits : \" If a card issuer decreases your credit limit, the card issuer can not charge you over-the-limit fees or a penalty rate for exceeding your new, lower credit limit, until 45 days after it has given you notice of the decreased credit limit. A card issuer can not charge you over-the-limit fees if it didnt give you notice of the decreased credit limit and if you havent opted into the payment of over-the-limit transactions. \n\nIn most instances, the card issuer must give you a adverse action notice when it makes certain unfavorable changes to your account, such as lowering your credit limit, or when it terminates your account. This notice should either provide specific reasons for the action taken or allow you to request a statement of specific reasons. These notices discourage discrimination and they help you learn the reasons for the decisions. '' When I made contact with Comenity Bank concerning my account, the representative advised me that there was \" nothing that she could do '' to assist with my account status and recommended that I request a credit limit increase or reapply for another card. This is not what I wanted to do being that I did nothing to warrant a credit limit decrease in the first place. My account was in good standing with them at the time of this action. They did not send me prior written notice via postage or email concerning the credit limit decrease. As you investigate my bank statements you will see that I did not have any past due amounts on the account to warrant such an action. Once again, my account was current.
