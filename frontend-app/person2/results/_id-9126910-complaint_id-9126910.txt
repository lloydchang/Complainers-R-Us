This whole problem situation began back in XX/XX/year> when I paid my Kohl 's charge card on the XXXX which is a XXXX. My payment is due on the first of each month. They didn't post this payment right away and then charged me {$40.00} for a late payment. Your agency got this resolved and I was given a credit. I, being a very responsible individual, decided to pay my Kohl 's payment for XXXX in advance at the end of XXXX. I did this so I would not be marked late and charged a late fee. Well, as you can see by my XXXX statement that Kohl 's went ahead and charged me a fee saying I didn't pay XXXX because they took my payment and added it to my account in XXXX so they could charge me a fee of {$40.00}. I had paid {$35.00} which was above and beyond my normal monthly payment of {$29.00}. i immediately called Kohl 's customer service department and spoke to XXXX who stated she had to transfer me to a Specialist named XXXX. I explained my situation and thinking and XXXX stated they did not apply my XX/XX/year> payment to XXXX so they charged me a fee of {$40.00}. I asked for her help in resolving this and I was refused. I was Not going to allow them to do this to me. I was an honest long time customer and this is outrageous. I paid XXXX, XXXX, XXXX on time on the first because of this ongoing issue that they refused to acknowledge or help me with. I paid {$35.00} every month instead of my normal required amount of {$29.00}. As you can see by the monthly statements from Kohl 's which I have attached, they went on to continue to charge me a XXXX XXXX  monthly fee. I contacted Kohl 's again at the beginning of XX/XX/year> to again try to get some resolution. That didn't happen. Instead, some woman asked if I am filing bankruptcy. I said, \" what??? '' What are you talking about? This whole situation insane. I told that person I had to file with you because I was getting nowhere with Kohl 's. I was being abused emotionally and financially. How could they do this to me when I paid on time and am a XXXX with XXXX??? I then had to call their automated service and make a payment. I see that they put on a XXXX fee of {$56.00} and I have no idea what this is. I really need help to get this all resolved. Any company that is decent would have helped me and resolved the issue back in XXXX instead of doing what they did to me. I need this resolved asap because I am Not paying fees when I did nothing wrong and the General Public needs to become aware of their tactics to financially ruin Senior Citizens. They also had the audacity to mark me late on my credit report!!! This mark which is incorrect needs to be removed.",
