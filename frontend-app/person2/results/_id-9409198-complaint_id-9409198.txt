  "complaint_what_happened": "CFPB Complaint- The response to the initial complaint had a few discrepancies as did the authorization date that you reported. I am sending another complaint due to these issues. \n\nAs you sctate in the response letter, The XX/XX/XXXX billing statement closed with XXXX transactions that posted to your account by the XX/XX/XXXX, cutoff date totaling {$950.00} for a grand total of {$990.00} spent towards the minimum spend amount. There were XXXX additional transactions included on the statement for {$13.00} and {$32.00} for XXXX XXXX XXXX that authorized on XX/XX/XXXX, and posted to your account on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX. As these transactions were not authorized on the account prior to XX/XX/XXXX, they were not included in the total to spend to receive the {$200.00} rewards bonus. \n\nWhen I spoke with you, you reported the transactions were authorized on XX/XX/XXXX. Further stating XXXX bills when it ships the product. I did not order the product on XX/XX/XXXX as evidenced by the XXXX paperwork attached. I ordered the items on XX/XX/XXXX. You said you had no way of knowing when I ordered it, however I have the proof in the XXXX paperwork that I have already sent your company. Now I called XXXX after speaking with you, XXXX, at the XXXX of the XXXX. I was told that US Bank authorized the charges on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX. XXXX gave me a code and stated you would be able to track this data with this code, XXXX. \n\nI have sent in all this information showing I spent {$1000.00} by XX/XX/XXXX and your company will not fulfill your end of the deal. Now, I have proof that the charges were authorized on XX/XX/XXXX. Thus, these XXXX orders should be counted in the total since as you say in the letter, Once a merchant authorizes a transaction, it will reflect on your account as a pending transaction immediately, if approved. And so these charges would have been immediately reflected on my account, since they were authorized and approved on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nAdditionally, you stated that XXXX bills when shipping the item. These XXXX orders consisted of XXXX items. XXXX item for {$18.00} shipped on XX/XX/XXXX, another for {$13.00} shipped on XX/XX/XXXX, and the third item shipped on XX/XX/XXXX. So according to your XXXX billing description, the item for {$18.00} should be included in the promotion since it was shipped on XX/XX/XXXX the last day of the promotion. Your company lists both orders as the transaction occurring on XX/XX/XXXX and as you can see, that is not correct. I dont know why the XXXX item for {$13.00} was not given a XX/XX/XXXX transaction date since it was shipped on XX/XX/XXXX. I sent a letter to your company requesting the transaction date be changed and that request was denied. Your company took the letter to mean I was disputing the charges and removed the charges initially. As you can see clearly in the letter, I was disputing the date of transaction and requesting a statement correction. \n\nI am upset that your company will not give me the cash reward as promised. You requested that I spend {$1000.00}, not that the purchases had to be delivered by XX/XX/XXXX or that the merchant had to bill by XX/XX/XXXX or that the items even had to post by XX/XX/XXXX. New account spend and get bonus is what you wrote in the letter. I spent the money prior to XX/XX/XXXX and your company authorized these orders on XX/XX/XXXX per XXXX, not XX/XX/XXXX per the response letter. These purchases were net eligible purchases. \n\nThis has been an awful situation and I am frustrated with your companies deceptive practices. I have tried to work with your company as evidenced by the following. \nOn XX/XX/XXXX, after waiting XXXX billing cycles for an award that never came, I called and was told I only spent {$990.00}. I explained that there was a {$41.00} net eligible purchase in XXXX and the XXXX + XXXX is over {$1000.00}. I ended up speaking to a supervisor who reviewed the bills and stated that I should receive the reward in 5 days. On XX/XX/XXXX when I still did not have the reward in my account, I called and was told that I was not qualifying due to the XXXX orders not being counted. That I was sent a letter denying the reward. I spoke to a supervisor then also. He ended up hanging up on me and telling me to go to the local branch. When I went to the local branch, they could not help and you did apologize for this misguided direction. You wrote in your response that, We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and frustration this matter has created for you, and regret that this matter was not resolved sooner. As your experience represents neither our standard, nor an acceptable level of service, your concerns were addressed with the appropriate levels of management to ensure that your experience is not repeated. We confirmed the agent submitted a request to review your account regarding the XXXX Account Spend and Get Bonus on XX/XX/XXXX. We reviewed the account and confirmed the minimum spend amount was not met within 120 days from account opening and the enclosed letter was issued to you on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nWhen I received your response to the CFPB complaint, I was very upset since your company is being deceptive and using inaccurate information to try to get out of paying the reward. I finally was able to speak to you and yet you continued to deny the XXXX XXXX orders were included. You stated that it had been too long and you would not know if the charges were authorized on XX/XX/XXXX. Thankfully when I called XXXX to see why the transaction date was XX/XX/XXXX when the product was ordered XX/XX/XXXX and shipped XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX had the authorization date and it was not XX/XX/XXXX as you state in the letter. Now I really hope this was just a mistake on your part and you will correct it now before we have to take this further. \n\nI did use inappropriate language and this situation is causing me a lot of anxiety and stress. I do not like to be lied to or stolen from. Especially since your company makes billions and you are being deceptive saying the charges authorized on XX/XX/XXXX and not before XX/XX/XXXX. I asked to speak with your supervisor and you stated there was no one above you. You stated I should be more professional and I usually am. However, if you want me to be professional when communicating with your company, dont lie and dont steal from me. I am a XXXX veteran and I really do not need this type of stress to continue. Additionally, I even sent a letter to correct the statement transaction date and your employee removed the charges stating I was disputing them. This correction was denied and it should not have been. \n\nIn summary, the rules say that I must make {$1000.00} in net eligible purchases. I made these purchases and I want the full {$200.00} put in my account. I am going to give you XXXX more chance to do the right thing. If you do not, I will have to take this further. If I do have to take you to arbitration or court, I will be requesting more money due to all the letters and phone calls and complaints I have had to complete just to get your company to fulfill the agreement. Additionally, I will need to get an attorney and so I will be calling XXXX as soon as I know if you correct this or not. My time is valuable, and this has caused me to be more anxious, more stressed and concerned about big banks trying to do me harm just because they can. If you still do not fulfill your end of the deal, I will demand arbitration or court. I understand that it costs me {$220.00} to file for arbitration and I will be asking for much more than the {$200.00} reward due to this stress and deceptive practice that your company is engaging in and the time and energy it has taken to get this corrected. I would hope that you make the correction and put the money I am due in my account. I want to believe that you did not know that your company authorized the charges on XX/XX/XXXX. I want to believe that you did not mean to do me harm by withholding the bonus. I have given you the code showing the correct authorization date. There are no more excuses to deny me the cash bonus of {$200.00}. I spent the money in time and there is no denying that now.",
