This morning {$210.00} was taken from my XXXX XXXX checking acct and used to payoff a Chase credit card that does NOT belong to me. Again, I have never had any Chase accounts nor credit lines nor mortgages nor car payments etc. Bottom line Chase took money from me without my authorization. Chase is JPM which is the largest bank in the US headed by XXXX XXXX and manages trillions in assets. I will make it the last thing I do to figure how and why this happened & how such a mistake was made so help me god. I am a middle class hard working individual and JPM/Chase will NOT get away with this!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nWorst of all I called Chase an hour ago and spoke to many individuals of foreign nature whom all sounded like they were from XXXX etc. and they all told me there is nothing they can do to help me.
