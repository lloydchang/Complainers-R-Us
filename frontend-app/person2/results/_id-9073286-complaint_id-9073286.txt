Chunk:
i was closing a checking account with wells fargo and there was a charge on my account which was charged to a credit card since the checking account was being closed. that charge was treated as a cash advance from the credit card company. i asked how i can pay off this cash advance and not be charged monthly interest, and i was informed that the only way to pay off the cash advance and avoid the interest is to pay off the whole balance of the card, which is over { $ 12000. 00 } to pay a cash advance charge of about { $ 50. 00 }. the card has an introductory purchase xxxx of xxxx xxxx and my balance is very high. i am currently not paying any interest on those purchases, so paying off the entire balance does not make sense for me. however, i am making minimum payments which pay down the balance. those minimum payments are not being used to pay off the cash advance. i think this is a potential issue since credit card companies are supposed to allocate payments to the highest xxxx accounts first. in effect, wells fargo is telling me that they are allocating my payments to the account that is charged xxxx xxxx xxxx instead of the cash advance accounts which charge about xxxx xxxx xxxx and that there is no way they can change this. i am positive that any xxxx with a credit card balance and a cash advance is facing the same issue. since this is wells fargo policy, and seems like it is out of compliance with the spirit of the laws dictating that higher xxxx products receive payments first, i think it would be worth looking into as it effects likely millions of americans.
