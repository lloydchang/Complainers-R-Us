I've tried to call back 2-3 times but no one pick up. On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a dispute with apple card Goldman Sachs , for faulty unit that not as described, stopped working, and unable to contact merchant via email or phone call, regardless of multiple attempts. No service were performed since they don't have a local office or a physical in person store, everything is online. I still haven't able to talk to anyone at the merchant, to this day. Apple card support kept opening and closing my dispute in favor of merchant with reason being not enough evidence to support my claim. I sent them my most recent email with the merchant and every information I do have. I am not able to reach the merchant for a solution and apple card support does not seem to understand.",
