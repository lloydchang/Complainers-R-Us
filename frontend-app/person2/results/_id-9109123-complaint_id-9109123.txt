I enrolled in XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, which gave me a 7-day free trial as a new customer, so the first charge occurred on XX/XX/XXXX. Although the Amex offer expired on XX/XX/XXXX, I did not think it would be a problem because there was a line explicitly saying If you are a new customer receiving a free trial, you must be enrolled in the free trial prior to the campaign end date to qualify. This line made believe that AMEX was aware that there is a free trial period and I would be fine as long as I enrolled in XXXXXXXX XXXX before the offer expired on XX/XX/XXXX, which I did enroll and sign up for XXXXXXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. And yet, AMEX declined to honor the offer and I did not get any cash back. I contacted AMEX first via online chat on XX/XX/XXXX, and then again on XX/XX/XXXX, and then called them on XX/XX/XXXX for 1 hour and 18 minutes. Each time I had to explain the situation to the representative all over again. There was a lot of frustration that they insisted that I can not get the rewards because first charge occurred XX/XX/XXXX, when the offer expired XX/XX/XXXX. And each representative declined to recognize that I should have been qualified because I enrolled XX/XX/XXXX before the offer expired according to their own marketing material.",
