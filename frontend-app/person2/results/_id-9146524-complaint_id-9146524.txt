They gave me a {$1500.00} credit limit, which barely gives me enough time to spend {$3500.00} by XX/XX/XXXX. I requested a credit limit increase and they declined. My first statement closed on XX/XX/XXXX and I paid it in full on XX/XX/XXXX, so I could start charging purchases to the card again towards the {$3500.00} requirement. For some reason my available balance is still only {$40.00}, even though I paid it in full 2 days ago, and the money has already cleared my bank. I called Citibank today to ask them what is going on. They told me there is a hold on my payment until XX/XX/XXXX, which is absurd! I have never had a credit card company do this before! Now I have only between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to spend another {$1500.00}, to stay on track for the {$3500.00} requirement. It really does look like Citi is trying to limit my spending so I don't qualify for the bonus miles offer. I have excellent credit, and I have never had a credit card offer me less than {$10000.00} limit. I have several expenses coming up, which I won't be able to put on this card because the limit is so low. I have to plan strategically which expenses can go on this card, so nothing gets declined. I want Citi to release my balance immediately, so I can start using the card again. I also want them to increase my credit limit to at least {$3000.00}, so I can charge my upcoming travel expenses to the card and make sure I qualify for the bonus miles.",
