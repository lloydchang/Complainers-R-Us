I went to check on the balance of the card yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, but the account was not listed on the XXXX portal. When I called them and asked what happened, the representative told me that the account was closed due to inactivity. But I have never received any notifications to that fact! It was very suspicious to me that they would close the account the very first time I made a purchase using this card. I have since read similar instances in various online forums where they closed accounts the moment a purchase was made. They claimed it was because of inactivity over one year from the date of issue, but there is another XXXX card that I have not used in over a year that is still open! They would not reinstate my account, and said that I would receive paper statements by which to pay my bill. Having elected paperless billing as I do with all accounts, this will force me into being charged {$2.00} every month for paper billing on an account that I can not access online. And they don't even know why it's not appearing in their online portal! This is shady business practice and they should be investigated.",
