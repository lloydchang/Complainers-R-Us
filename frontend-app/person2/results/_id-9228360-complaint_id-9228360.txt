The woman at Amex said she would resubmit and asked me to check back in 7 days. \n\nNow I get an email from Amex saying the credit for {$4300.00} has been reversed. \nI did use the tickets for XXXX I have spent countless hours on this and now, want a resolution ending with a full credit for both tickets. \n\nA duplicate ticket shouldve never been issued, and this is not my fault I did use the other tickets as planned Booking Confirmation # : XXXX",
