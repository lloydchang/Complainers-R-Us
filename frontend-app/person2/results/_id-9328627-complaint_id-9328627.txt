I did not receive an electronic or paper bill the following month. Then, on XX/XX/year>, I received a paper bill, indicating that my account is now delinquent, incurring {$27.00} late charges and {$6.00} in interest charges. I called Synchrony, they informed that they never got the notice to switch to paperless, and that the bill was sent ( though it was never received ). They said they would wave the late charge but would not waive the interest charge. Its ridiculous to charge people to get statements, but even more ridiculous to penalize them when they don't receive them. My credit score is XXXX and I have literally never missed a payment before for anything. I believe this is a deceptive practice they are employing to attempt to extract fees and interest from customers like myself that generally don't pay any of these things based on how they are used.",
