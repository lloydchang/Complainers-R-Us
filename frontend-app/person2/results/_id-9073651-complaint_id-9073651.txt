I dont know the name of the company because tjmax didnt provide it. I kept getting new credit cards in the mail, and wondering why because the expiration date wasnt an issue. I called them, and said it could be from inside your company thats doing this. Customer service told me they resolved the problem. I closed this card several months ago & theres more charges sent to me in the mail today. Card wasnt open long due to tjmax credit card double charging in the beginning of having the card. They have very poor customer service, with people saying different things regarding protocol. Most were of a foreign accent with a language comprehension issue, and a few were very rude yelling at me. Tjmax customer service is the worst I have ever experienced sadly, and their accounting practices are fraudulent. They lost my business! \nPlease exonerate me of this fraudulent hacking and remove it from my credit report. The amount is {$150.00} of fraud charges.",
