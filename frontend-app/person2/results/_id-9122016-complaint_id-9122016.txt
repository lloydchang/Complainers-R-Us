She has no balance, she has no income to pay and Elan charges a {$99.00} annual fee.

I did that. in XXXX I received a letter stating Elan would need my personal social security number and date of birth to add me to the account. I spoke to my Attorney, there is no reason why I need to be added to the account. I am legally working on my Mom 's behalf. My request was clear. Please close the Account. My Mother has no ability to pay. \n\nThe Company recently sent my Mom an invoice again for her {$99.00} annual fee. Its like you can't close the account because the Company won't be able to collect this fee each year from her. She is XXXX. And again in a XXXXXXXX XXXX",
