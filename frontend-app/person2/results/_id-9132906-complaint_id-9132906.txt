My flight was canceled and all the rebooking options given to me involved overnight layovers without any offer of hotel cost reimbursement, so I requested a refund of the original fare and booked a new flight through SoFi Travel.

On XX/XX/XXXX, only four days before I was scheduled to leave ( and less than three weeks before the XXXX XXXX flight was to occur ), I received a notice from SoFi Travel that my flight had been canceled.

I checked on XXXX XXXX online flight portal and was given a few other rebooking options, all of which also had overnight layovers in XXXX. ( See Figures XXXX and XXXX ) Neither SoFi Travel nor XXXX XXXX offered reimbursement for the hotel, transportation, or meal costs that the overnight layovers would require. Additionally, as a lone XXXX  traveler, I did not feel comfortable taking an overnight layover in a country I had not planned to visit and where I do not speak the language.\n\nI called SoFi Travel and spoke at length with an agent who said that all the rebooking options he found with XXXX XXXX involve an overnight layover, and who said that all the other flight options were substantially more expensive ( well over {$1000.00} ). On his advice, we canceled the XXXX XXXX flight to request a full refund, and I independently booked a new flight via SoFi Travels online portal.

It was the only option I found that was under {$1000.00} and did not involve additional stops or an overnight layover.\n\nOn various phone calls with SoFi Travel, I requested a refund both of the original amount ( {$560.00} ) and the additional difference I had to pay for the XXXX XXXX flight ( {$590.00}, an additional {$34.00} ). The first SoFi Travel customer service agent I reached insisted that they worked for BILT Rewards, not SoFi, and refused to help me. After I re-called the same customer service number ( at base of email in Figure XXXX ), another agent said they could process a refund of the original amount but not the difference between flights. \n\nI am submitting this complaint to request : ( 1 ) A refund of the difference between the two flights ( {$34.00} ), either from XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX. \n\n( 2 ) An investigation, either by SoFi Travels own management or the appropriate regulatory authority, into why it is failing to train customer service agents to know which company they work for.
