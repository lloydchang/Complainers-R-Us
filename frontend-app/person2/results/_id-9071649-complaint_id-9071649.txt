After reviewing my account, I was shocked to discover that a purchase was made to XXXX XXXX XXXX. Affirm approved the loan and provided a loan number : XXXX. The down payment was {$220.00}, paid on XX/XX/2024. \nI contacted Affirm and alerted them that I had not made this purchase and that they should investigate and remove all charges, including canceling this order. They advised me they would take a closer look and investigate the matter and would email me their findings. After a few days, I received an email from Affirm concluding that I was responsible for this loan. I have contacted them again ( 4 times ), and each time, they returned with an email concluding I was responsible for this loan and suggested contacting the merchant, XXXX XXXX XXXX. I took their advice and contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX, the merchant. XXXX XXXX XXXX confirmed they had no record of any order under my name or email associated with the loan number provided. The merchant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, initiated a three-way call with Affirm and myself and informed Affirm that they, the merchant, had no record of any order under my name, my email, or that loan number, and they requested to remove this loan and cancel the order. Affirm then advised us that they will go under further investigation again with no promise they will remove this fraudulent loan even though the merchant told them it is a fraud order. I was advised by the merchant to contact you because they also felt that Affirm is not willing to resolve the issue. At this point, I have no choice but to seek your assistance in resolving this issue due to the fact that Affirm shows the first payment due on XX/XX/XXXX, followed by the rest of the payments on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX",
