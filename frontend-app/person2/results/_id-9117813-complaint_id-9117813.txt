A case was opened for the inquiry. The case number is XXXX. I just spoke to someone concerning this and was told that one of the purchases ( XX/XX/year> ) was not eligible because it was a Mastercard purchase. The Care Credit card is a Mastercard and the promotion mentions that to receive the offer you need to use the Care Credit Mastercard, which I did. I made a total of {$280.00} purchases using the credit card which is more than the required {$250.00}. They told me nothing could be done. I double checked today and made sure that they knew that I would be contacting the CFPB if they are unable to assist to resolve this issue. They verified that they couldn't do anything.",
