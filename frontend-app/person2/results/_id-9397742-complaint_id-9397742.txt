I paid for this {$290.00} Subscription via Barclays Credit Card ( this Barclays Bank Card is shown as FRONTIER on the card ). It is not 100 % clear to me the relationship between Barclays Bank and Frontier Airlines, however, since neither Company wants to fix my ridiculous predicament, I claim they are in \" Cahoots '' with each other!\n\nApparently, when I made this purchase in XXXX of XXXX, somewhere buried deep within the small print is my agreement to have an indefinite ongoing Non-Refundable AUTO-RENEWED subscription each year. I was unaware of this clause and had no idea that next year this Subscription would just Auto Renew again. However, that is not even the main issue here. Once I got a late fee on a Credit Card that I never use, I investigated this only to find the {$290.00} Subscription was auto-renewed in XX/XX/XXXX but does not even become active until the end of this year. I told Frontier Airlines I do not wish to have this Subscription for XXXX as they changed their available flight schedule and the reason I purchased this was to use a flight from CO to TN, which is no longer offered. I was told this {$290.00} Auto-Renewed Subscription is Non-Refundable and that even though I have not used and it is not available until XXXX, I am stuck with it. So I called Barclays and opened up a Dispute ( XXXX ) and submitted both a written letter explaining all of this ( which I am happy to include below ) and copies of the Text Transcripts with Frontier Airlines ( they no longer offer any human correspondence ). \n\nI just got a letter today from Barclays stating they will not be crediting me the {$290.00} and that the charge stands because \" The merchant has not violated the terms and conditions of the sales agreement.

I clearly have given Frontier enough notice and time to Cancel ( 8 months advance notice ). To try and force a Non-Refundable clause on me from something I knew nothing about as it was a year ago when I signed up is crazy. This is flat out wrong as I was never told originally this Subscription would be on Auto-Renewal with No Refunds. I would have never allowed that had someone told me that. What they did was to sneak that information into a buried small print clause in the hopes this exact situation would happen. So wrong! \n\nI hope all of this information helps. By the way when I called Barclays Bank back today they simply confirmed they will not be issuing me any kind of a refund and the original change stands as when I made the original purchase back in XXXX I also agreed to a Non-Refundable Automatic Renewal -- The End! : ( HERE IS WHAT I SENT BARCLAYS BANK : XX/XX/XXXX Barclays Dispute Department XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, DE XXXX Tel : XXXX Fax : XXXX Dispute Case : XXXX TO WHOM IT MAY CONCER : With regard to my Dispute with Frontier Airlines and the {$290.00} Automatic Renewal Go Wild Winter Subscription, I was finally able to get ahold of someone via a Chat Service they offer. I was told by this person in Chat that they no longer offer any form of communication other than written via Chat, Social Media or Email. I asked for a Transcript of my Chat with them today and will enclose it for your review. \n\nApparently when I originally signed up for the XXXX XXXX XXXX Subscription in XXXX of XXXX, there was some Terms and Conditions part that says this Winter Subscription ( valid only XXXX XXXX ), will auto renew each year and is non-refundable.
