On XX/XX/XXXX went into online account to check balance so I would have correct balance due. \nCaught off guard because the balance was so high, which I looked at the only correspondence from company regarding my account. I only get statements online, no emails, text messages, or mail. \nThe statement showed ending XX/XX/XXXX where the balance was at almost {$2400.00}, with a notation saying promotional period will be ending shortly ( I had believed promotional period would end in XXXX ). \nFound out during conversation with companies customer service that the total balance ( which was about {$2400.00} ) now had the total interest ( 32.99 % ) of about {$1600.00} added onto on balance. Company did this on XX/XX/XXXX when they said promotional period ended. \nLooked at next statement ( that is only provided online, which I had never looked at, only making all necessary payments online ). \nXXXX statement showed additional interest charged adding almost an additional {$150.00} to balance, now bringing total due over {$4000.00}. Figures are not exact, but approximate since I didn't know if I was to download all statements. I have always made monthly payments, trying to make payments a little more. \nBut no other form of communications ( email, texts, letters, etc ) were provided that promotional period was ending ( except in a note on online statement ) helping me as a great citizen who pays her bills! \nI communicated all information to the company that on XX/XX/XXXX I was going into my account to pay, in full, my balance due of about {$2400.00}. I informed them I thought promotional period ended in XXXX and that is why I planned to pay balance in full. I actually begged and pleaded to eliminate interest and I would pay immediately. They refused. Talked to management and was told that the COMPUTER would not allow that. \nWas shocked that a computer dictated how a good paying customer, could be denied the common courtesy to eliminate interest charges that I know every company could adjust with management approval. Now this will effect and seriously hurt my credit score which has always been top notch. \nSo this company said in a online statement that promotional period would end shortly ( no actual date or month was provided as far as I know ) which a date on statement said XX/XX/XXXX. Then on XX/XX/XXXX when attempt to pay balance in full was made is when I saw the whole promotional period interest was added.
