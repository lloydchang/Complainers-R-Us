I traveled to XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX and was planning on renting a car from XXXX XXXX XXXX I went to the office to rent, but the cost came out to {$300.00} vs the {$100.00} XXXX expected to pay, so I did not go through with this purchase. I rented a car with a different company instead. However, I had already handed over my credit card and XXXX had all my information because I booked a reservation online. \n\nXXXX stole my credit card information to pay for a rental car even though I did not authorize this transaction. I never received a rental car from this company. However, they charged my card despite this. They used my personal information to validate this charge, but this was all fraudulent. \n\nI have never disputed a credit card charge in my life. I have never opened a fraud case before. I strongly believe against this charge because I never received a rental car from this company. They forged my signature and created a fake receipt of a rental car. \n\nI opened a dispute with Chase to report this fraud, but Chase has refused to listen to me despite XXXX attempts to explain the situation. They say they have proof that the charge is valid, but have not given me any proof except the fake receipt and forged signature. I have explained the situation to them and they do not talk to me directly. This is why I am filing this report. Thank you very much. I am an extremely honest person and truly can not stand by this company scamming people in such a way!",
