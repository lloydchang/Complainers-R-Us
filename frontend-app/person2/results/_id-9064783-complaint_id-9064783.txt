This started when I bought a flight ticket on XX/XX/year> from XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$200.00}. When I bought this ticket, the XXXX website can consistently stated that if I want to cancel for a full refund I can do so within a XXXX Window. When I called in later that day on XX/XX/year> to cancel the ticket with the goal of getting that full refund promised by the airline. When I went on their website, they stated that an error occurred and to come back later. Well how am I supposed to do that if I want a refund within a XXXX XXXX. When their website had an error, I called their customer service over XXXX times and each time they states that they had a system outage and weren't able to process refunds. With that being said, they stated, \" Call back later and we will be able to cancel your ticket for a full refund. '' With this being said I called back later and to my surprise they stated that I needed to show proof that they had an outage and request a refund with time, not instantly like they took my money. When I sent the proof, the customer service representative was on the line with me for over an hour, and she stated that indeed they had a system outage and she promised I'd get a full refund and apologized for the mess this has created. When I get a confirmation of my refund, behold they state that I had a non-refundable ticket and could only get {$75.00}, this is unacceptable especially when the company representative has admitted fault. I've got proof of trying to cancel my ticket on XX/XX/year> for a full refund of {$200.00}, this can be proved with time-stamped screenshots and phone calls! I've requested numerous disputes through American Express and they have stated that it is my problem, they will not work with XXXX to resolve this dispute, I want an entire refund. XXXXXXXX XXXX mistake is not my price to pay, please understand how frustrating and stressful this can be!",
