Some places in my account said that my next payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX ; others said XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX part of my account also said I had a past-due amount. I was confused and contacted customer service. The person I spoke with insisted my payment date had never been changed and that I did have a past due amount.
