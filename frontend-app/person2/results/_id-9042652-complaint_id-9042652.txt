By XX/XX/XXXX, the payment was posted to my account but my credit available did not reflect the payment. My credit limit still showed it was {$2000.00}, so I knew they didn't decide to lower it. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Care Credits customer service. I was informed that \" it happens all the time '' and that \" due to the large payment amount, the payment was being held until it cleared my bank ''. I thought this was odd as I have made payment of {$1000.00} and the available credit reflected the payment within two or three business days. After I hung up, I researched their terms and Conditions in regards to payments made online. I found that in summary, it says that the payment will post to the account within XXXX  hours and that the available credit, subject to funds received from the bank, will increase within XXXX business days. There is no mention regarding payments being held due to them being \" a large amount ''. On XX/XX/XXXX, I checked my account and the available credit still had not reflected the {$800.00} payment. I checked my bank and the payment cleared through them on the XXXX. I phoned customer service again to be told that because the payment was over {$500.00} it was being held until the XXXX. I confirmed with him that they did receive the funds on the XXXX. I informed him that I have made payments in the amount of {$1000.00} and the payment was not held. He reiterated that that was their policy to hold payment over {$500.00}. I informed him that that is not stated in their terms and conditions for online payments. Again he stated that that was their policy. I asked for a supervisor and he said he would get one but they will tell me the same thing. I was then connected to XXXX. I again told her I made the payment on the XXXX and it cleared my bank on the XXXX but it still didn't reflect in my available credit. She told me, just as the man told me ; that it was their policy to hold all payments over {$500.00}. I read to her their terms and conditions for online payments and asked her where I could find it, within their terms and conditions that it says that. She simply replied that it's the policy. I informed her that why is it I have to abide by their terms and conditions but that they don't. Again, she told me it was their policy. I told her they are breaking their contract with me since I had to agree to their terms and conditions but that they aren't. I asked her to email me, where in their terms and conditions ; it states that online payments over {$500.00} would be held. I said I want to see that in writing. She put me on hold for XXXX minutes and then the call disconnected. They also state that consumers will be notified if changes to their terms and conditions change. No notification has been sent and according to their site, it was last updated XXXX of XXXX",
