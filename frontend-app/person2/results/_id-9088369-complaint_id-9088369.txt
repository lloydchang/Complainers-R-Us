This credit account is closed and has not been used so there is no reason I should owe more than the required XXXX. Today XX/XX/24 I went in to make sure my payment posted that I paid yesterday and it did not. So I had to pay the XXXX today and next month I will be charged another late fee on top of whatever other fees XXXX decides to tact on. This is not right that I keep getting charged all these fees on a closed account. This is fraud. And I am keeping a paper trail cause I am obtaining an attorney.
