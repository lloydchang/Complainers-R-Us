As I was clearing through them, I noticed a hotel booking confirmation for XXXX. \nIt was a hotel booking at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX And XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$500.00}. I did not make this purchase. It still had my name and contact info on the reservation. \n\nI called XXXX to tell them I did not make this purchase. They told me they could not cancel the reservation since it was a prepaid, same-day reservation and the credit card charged to it was already billed and the hotel was paid. \n\nSo on XX/XX/XXXX, I called Chase to report a fraudulent transaction. The Chase agent told me the charge was made to a card ending in XXXX  XXXX a card number I cancelled in XX/XX/XXXX due to attempted fraudulent attempts.

They told me it was up to me to prove I did not make the purchase and that someone else benefited. \nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX for the receipt and they sent me a contract showing the reservation was made against my old, replaced credit card number. They told me they can not provide more information as I have already filed a credit dispute. \nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I called the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX And XXXX XXXX XXXX to ask for the hotel 's receipt and information on who used the reservation.
