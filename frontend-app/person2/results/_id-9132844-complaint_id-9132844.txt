On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a {$20000.00} payment through the Synchrony Bank credit card website, and the funds were withdrawn from my XXXX account the following day. However, despite this prompt withdrawal, I discovered on XX/XX/XXXX, that these funds have not been applied to my available credit. \n\nUpon calling customer service, I was informed by XXXX, a XXXX, that my payment would be held for XXXX  days, with a release date of XX/XX/XXXX. Another representative explained that my \" huge '' payment is being held because it exceeds {$7900.00}. I routinely make monthly payments greater than {$8000.00}, so I asked if I should expect all my payments to be held for XXXX days. If there is such a business rule in place, why was I not notified of this hold before making my payment? I only learned of this hold when I noticed my credit limit had not been updated after XXXX days. My requests to release the hold or extend my credit limit were declined. \n\nI find this XXXX hold without prior notification both unreasonable and unacceptable. Synchrony Bank initiated the payment via XXXX and withdrew the funds promptly, so I do not understand the justification for this lengthy hold. This situation has caused significant inconvenience and feels like an abusive practice towards consumers. \n\nI initially chose Synchrony Bank due to its partnership with XXXX, with whom I have been a customer since 2001. However, this experience has led me to reconsider my banking relationships. I am now forced to reset all my auto payments and move my business back to Chase, where I have never encountered such issues. \n\nI urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate this matter and ensure that Synchrony Bank 's practices are in compliance with fair consumer treatment standards. This situation reflects poor business decision-making and a disregard for customer satisfaction. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.",
