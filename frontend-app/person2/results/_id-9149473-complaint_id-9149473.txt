Chunk:
these charges on my account are fraud, the credit card was stolen and used without permission, i contacted the bank they said they would take care of the charges they never did i got a statement and called and spoke to fraud and filed a fraud claim, they stated they would take care of the charges on the account, the charges were now rebilled, these charges are fraud and not made by me nor my authorized user, the credit card was stolen, remove the charges immediately. i have attached a fraud affidavit with ftc. this is unacceptable for you to charge me for charges unauthorized by me
