The merchandise received ( a box of gloves and a box of masks ) was defective, damaged during shipping. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>, I submitted the requested information and clarification via BoA 's online secure message center, detailing the damage to the merchandise. On XX/XX/year>, BoA issued a temporary credit and assured me they were investigating the dispute. Despite providing the requested information and additional clarification, BoA denied my claim on XX/XX/year>, stating : \" Although we understand youre unsatisfied with what was provided, the merchant XXXX charge you for any service or merchandise that you received. '' BoA failed to investigate my claim under XXXX dispute reason code 13.3 ( Merchandise/Service Not as Described or Defective ) or 13.5 ( Misrepresentation ). The claim clearly illustrates that the merchandise was damaged, constituting a defective product.\n\nUnder the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) and Consumer Credit Protection Act, I have the right to dispute billing errors, which include receiving damaged or defective merchandise. BoA 's handling of my dispute appears to violate these protections by not conducting a thorough investigation and incorrectly categorizing my claim as dissatisfaction rather than addressing the defect.\n\nBoA has a pattern of denying legitimate claims only to later acknowledge their oversight. This points to a systemic issue of reducing manhours spent on legitimate customer issues rather than ensuring fair investigations. Despite my efforts and clear evidence, BoA 's final response did not reflect a thorough investigation.\n\nAdditionally, BoA provided false assurance that my claim was being looked into. Their letter dated XX/XX/year>, indicated they were working to resolve the dispute directly with the merchant, which proved misleading as their final decision did not reflect a genuine investigation.",
