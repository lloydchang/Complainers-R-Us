I always click \" activate '' on these offers and save the emails just in case this happens. The fact that they have no way of backing up what they are saying, and I have no way of proving it makes me feel that they never intended to honor the promotion, and others may be in a similar situation due to their bug/error. It is completely misleading to offer this promotion to spend and get, but not provide the certificate in the end. I am beyond disappointed with this experience, and I hope they will honor the promotion that the advertised.",
