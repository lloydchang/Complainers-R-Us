  "complaint_what_happened": "In XXXX of XXXX someone attempted to open several credit card accounts in my name. When I got back to town after holiday travel on XX/XX/XXXX I had multiple letters from credit card companies information me that this had occurred. I immediately contacted all of them. XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, Bank XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Comenity, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX all received applications and all denied the applications by doing their due diligence search, seeing that there were an unusual number for applications and sending me a letter denying the application without the submission of further information. None of these companies approved the fraudulent applications and all those accounts were closed. Citi had XXXX applications. The application for the Citi card was denied. I received a letter saying further action would be required in order to open the account. I called them and they close that account. However, the Citi AAdvantage card extended credit without the proper information. They sent me a letter on XX/XX/XXXX that says \" we determined that your newly opened Citi/XXXX account requires additional verification. '' The account was flagged as suspicious. However, they extended credit prior to receiving this verification and the person charged {$560.00} on the card. On XX/XX/XXXX I called and notified them the account was fraudulent. They told me they would close the account and open an investigation. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a bill from them for {$580.00} ( the original charge plus interest ). I called and was told to speak to their fraud team. Then I was transferred to their XXXX XXXX XXXX. After being transferred to several people I was told it was still under investigation. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a new bill, now for {$620.00} ( the original amount plus interest and fees ). I spoke to customer service who transferred me to their fraud department, who then transferred me to their collections department, who then told me I needed to speak to customer services. I asked to speak to a supervisor multiple times but was continually transferred back to customer service and asked to give the same information multiple times. Each time the call was transferred the connection was worse to the point that after XXXX hours on the phone I had to hang up because I couldn't understand the person and they continually refused to resolve the issue or put me through to a supervisor. On XX/XX/XXXX I received letters stating that their investigation was closed and that I am responsible for the charges on this account because cards were mailed to an address that belongs to me ( which they weren't ). Clearly this account is fraudulent and this company extended credit without the proper due diligence that all of the other companies completed, including Citi itself.",
