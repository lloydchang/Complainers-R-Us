Below is a detailed history of my experience : XXXX. In XXXX, I applied for American Express XXXX XXXX XXXX. At no point during the application was I informed of any restrictions or conditions that would render me ineligible for the welcome bonus. \n\nXXXX. After submitting the Application, the Application remained pending, therefore, I called the number displayed on the screen.\n\n3. During the call, I was trying to ask why the Application is pending, and as we speak, the Application is approved. \n\nXXXX. After Approval, I remained on the call, and asked the representative from American Express to check the Welcome Bonus. \n\nXXXX. It was communicated to me that the Welcome Bonus is {$10000.00} USD spent to receive XXXX Membership Rewards Points within 3 months of card opening. \n\nXXXX. In late XXXX, I called American Express Customer Service again, to check how's my progression the Welcome Bonus. And I was notified that the Welcome Bonus is not available to me. \n\nXXXX. I immediately escalated the case, and the representative created an internal investigation to request the previous phone call. And I was asked to wait for XXXX weeks to call back to check the investigation. \n\nXXXX. In XXXX, I called American Express Customer Service again to see if the investigation is finished. And, yes, the investigation has finished, but the conclusion is that I am still not eligible for the Welcome Bonus despite the fact that American Express was able to confirm that the first Representative did say that the welcome bonus is {$10000.00} USD spent to receive XXXX Membership Rewards Points within 3 months of card opening. \n\nXXXX. In the same phone call, I kept escalating. After XXXX rounds of escalation, the supervisor is only able to issue a {$50.00} USD statement credit to my account to compensate for the miscommunication, which is not comparable to the Welcome Bonus that I was communicated with. \n-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - This series of events highlights a clear case of miscommunication and misrepresentation by American Express. As a long-standing customer, I find this treatment to be unacceptable and detrimental. I seek a full investigation into this matter and appropriate remedial action. \n\nAs a customer, I was tricked, scammed and wrongly communicated.
