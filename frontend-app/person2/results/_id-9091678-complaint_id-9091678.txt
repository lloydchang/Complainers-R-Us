My limit has never gone up because it's a secured card. \n\n- I have called suncoast repeatedly, about every two years, to confirm this information is correct and I will get my deposit back, because financially, I need it back. They have ALWAYS confirmed it. \n\n- Sometime in XXXX my card expired and SC sent me a new one. I remember because I got multiple closed cards added to my account because SC kept sending cards to the wrong address, which still impacts my credit score to this day. This new card was a starter card - Suncoast switched my secured card out for a starter card. I called to confirm I would still get the deposit back, and on the phone they told me that I would still get my deposit back. \n\n- XX/XX/XXXX, I sit patiently on phone for the SC employee to tell me that I don't have a secured card I have a starter card. He goes through everything and says actually I see it here, you did have a secured card, we're processing the change now, ( I have to shift to a normal credit card to get my deposit back which was fine cause that's what I was told ) he says the {$500.00} will be in my account monday. \n\n- XX/XX/XXXX, I call again because the money is not there. I sit patiently on phone for the SC employee to tell me that I don't have a secured card, I have a starter card. She goes through everything and transfers me to lending. The woman at lending says actually I see it here, you did have a secured card, we're processing the change now, she says the {$500.00} will be in my account in about a week, her reasoning was that he just gave me a bad estimate. She even mentioned that she can see the {$500.00} processing into my account, so just give it a few more days. \n\n- XX/XX/XXXX, this is now the exact excuse they're using, that I never had a secured card, only a starter card. Even though as early as XXXX that wasn't the story, and I was getting my money back. The woman on the phone even claimed that I can go find this information, even though I have screenshots proving that I can't see past XXXX anywhere. She told me that was fine because they were sending me my documents, they didn't. I just checked my mailbox. \n\nIt is clear that I have worked patiently for suncoast to get this money, or even my credit card records back, They have refused me about 4-5 times - as reflected in my call logs with Suncoast.",
