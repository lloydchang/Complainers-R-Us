On XX/XX/XXXX, {$870.00} was charged to my Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card for tickets to a XXXX XXXX concert in XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX. When I caught the charge, on XX/XX/XXXX, I immediately called Chase and had my card cancelled. Chase refunded the purchase and I thought that was the end of the matter. \nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Chase stating that I had received the benefit of the transaction, and that they were charging the sum of money back to my card. I called, and I was instructed to call XXXX XXXX, because XXXX XXXX would not release any of my personal information. The charge had come from my email and my account, so it appeared that I had made this purchase myself. I noted that this came as a result of my email being hacked, so of course it would appear that this charge came from me. I called XXXX XXXX who asked why I waited so long to contact them- and they informed me that they would start an investigation into this charge. Chase called today, XX/XX/XXXX, to follow up. Absolutely nothing had been done on behalf of Chase. I contacted XXXX XXXX, who informed me I need documentation from Chase stating that this is fraudulent, so that they could begin investigating. I called Chase back at XXXX XXXX XXXX and was informed that they would do nothing because their work day ends at XXXX XXXX XXXX \nGiven that XXXX months has elapsed, I question why documentation has not occurred between Chase and XXXX XXXX to the effect of a fraudulent claim. Chase is not active in their investigation, nor is XXXX XXXX. I also question why I am expected to do the communicating between these XXXX companies, especially when Chase charges an annual fee and is FDIC insured for this sum of money.",
