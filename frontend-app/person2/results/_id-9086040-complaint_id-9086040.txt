They have charged me with fraudulent charges that they have created. I discovered that I had lost my original credit card XXXX XXXX and reported it to them. They closed that card and issued me a new card. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I looked online and saw that fraudulent charges had been made on the replacement card that was issued, but I never received. The new replacement card was stolen during the mailing process. I never received the card. There were XXXX charges made on the stolen card from spanning from XXXX XXXX, XXXX through XXXX XXXX, XXXX, totaling {$990.00}. There could not have been any other charges on the card after XXXX XXXX, XXXX as the card was cancelled. When they sent me a new replacement card for the stolen card they carried the total balance forward of {$990.00} and then they carried forward XXXX of the XXXX individual charges that made up the original amount of {$990.00}. They double billed me for XXXX of the XXXX fraudulent charges. From there, their accounting department has made so many mistakes that are very clearly showing on the bill statements. My bill grew from {$990.00} to {$1700.00} after the card was cancelled and a new card was issued due to their accounting mistakes. The fraud claim was approved and they are now billing me for charges that they created due to their own accounting errors, otherwise looked at by me as fraudulent charges that they, Synchrony Bank, have created on my account. I have a copy of every bill since this issue started, and they have admitted over and over again that they have made a mistake, and they tell me each time I have called that they will get it corrected. This has been going on since XXXX XXXX and they still do not have it corrected. I have documents stating that the fraud claim for the {$990.00} was approved, yet they continue to bill me {$720.00} plus interest on their own fraudulent charges that they have created with their accounting mistakes. My bill is now {$740.00}.",
