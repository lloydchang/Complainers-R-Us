In XXXX of XXXX I was charged a {$1900.00} interest charge as well as a 29.9 % interest charge every month of this year. I believe this is deceptive and predatory as they advertise it as interest free so you go into the loan assuming it is set up to meet all the requirements that make it interest free. Instead, it's set up in such as way as that it drags out past the 0 % interest cut off point and they charge you for all of the interest up to that point ( {$1900.00} ). I would have had no problem paying whatever amount would have been needed to meet this cutoff point as that's what I assumed I was doing but now all of a sudden I owe more than the original amount of the loan after paying for over XXXX years.",
