I initially sent it via email on their website, and I have followed up with a paper letter to their XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX. \n\nIve been a Barclays JetBlue XXXX cardholder for years and have always been pleased with the service and benefits of my card ; that is until recently. In XX/XX/XXXX I moved to the XXXX XXXX to pursue a XXXX. My mail was initially forwarded to my sisters house in XXXX until I found an apartment in the XXXX. \n\nOn XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I called the number listed on the back of my card as an XXXX XXXX XXXX ; XXXX. I wanted to have my new address in the XXXX listed as my primary address and went through about XXXX levels of security, to determine I really was who I said I was, could show proof of residency, etc., which I considered great due diligence on your part. This call lasted XXXX minutes and I was told my address would be updated to my XXXX address. \n\nThe next time I tried to use my card online with my XXXX address, it wouldnt work, and I realized the billing address was defaulting to my sisters address in XXXX. \nI then called Barclays back again on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to follow up on the address change. This call took another XXXX minutes, and I was eventually informed my Barclays JetBlue XXXX could not have an address outside the US. Although this was contrary to the information I received during my first call, on XXXX XXXX, it seemed there was nothing I could do. \n\nThen, on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I received my phone bill from XXXX only to find charges for both calls had apparently been back-charged from Barclays to my phone bill, even though I was using the XXXXXXXX XXXX number  listed on the back of Barclays JetBlue XXXX . The common definition of a collect call is that the person receiving the call pays the charges. Otherwise, the person making the call would be paying the charges. It is disingenuous on the part of Barclays to list an XXXX XXXX call number on the back of the card and then back-charge it to the person making the call. That is not a XXXX  call. And not only was I back charged for the calls, the rates were XXXX. \n\nThe first call, at which I received incorrect information about my address change was at a rate of XXXX ( {$5.00} ) per minute ; the second call was charged back at XXXX ( {$5.00} ) per minute. I only had to make the second call because I was informed incorrectly on the first call by multiple customer services representatives that my residential address could be changed. I was thus billed by Barclays for XXXX ( {$98.00} ) due to incorrect information on both my credit card ( which states its an XXXX XXXX call when it clearly is not ) and the team who was handling my change of address, who gave me the wrong information on the first call. \n\nIt also states the following on your website at the following location : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The website clearly states Please call us free of charge and that We will also accept the charges is repeated in XXXX different places. If this policy has changed, your own documentation does not reflect that. And nowhere does it state that we will back charge you the cardholder, for these calls even though it clearly states Please call us free of charge. \n\nI would like the XXXX ( {$98.00} ) charges for these phone calls credited to my card, and it would behoove the company to make explicit that the XXXX XXXX  phone number listed on the card is not actually a XXXX  call. \n\nAs I mentioned previously, I have enjoyed the benefits and usage of my JetBlue card, but I am seriously considering closing my account if this situation is not rectified. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to hearing from you.",
