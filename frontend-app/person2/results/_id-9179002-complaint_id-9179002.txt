After I entered in {$2000.00} for my payment, a Chase notification popped up asking if I wanted to make a payment toward my statement balance of {$17000.00}. I tapped yes, which inadvertently processed payment for the full balance. I called Chase almost immediately to notify them of my mistake. and was told there's absolutely nothing I can do and that the amount will be returned XXXX times. It froze my card. I made many calls to try to speak with someone other than out-of-country customer service and no one would help. I begged and pleaded for consideration, and no one would let me pass customer service. The issue now is that my payments are held for XXXX  days or more. Chase currently has {$9000.00} of my money that I can not access. I have made payments exceeding {$15000.00} since my mistake in an effort to bring this back to good standing and Chase refuses to release the hold or give me a timeline for my punishment. Prior to my error, my payment was posted the next day. I have been a chase customer in good standing for XXXX plus years. In the meantime, I can't access {$9000.00} for my business. It's not in my checking and Chase won't let me use the credit. Chase is able to earn interest on these holds while they're out of my account but not accessible. It also is negative impacting my XXXX XXXX because instead of showing {$9000.00} is available credit, it's much lower. This morning, a charge was declined for {$1000.00} and it's a payment that is necessary for my business. Because Chase refuses to give me information about how long this hold will last, I keep issuing payments to help my cause but it has been unsuccessful. Please help me and other consumers! I made a mistake, and this is going to cost me my business. Chase refuses to consider my situation, refuses to give me specific information on how to fix my current situation and is dismissing me.
