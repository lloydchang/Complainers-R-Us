The transaction was processed on XX/XX/2024, but the amount has yet to be posted to my XXXX account. I have reviewed my XXXX statements for the past four months, and there is no record of this {$1400.00} transfer from Barclays. Despite contacting XXXX three times, they have confirmed that no such payment was received. I have also reached out to Barclays multiple times and have attached summaries of some of these interactions for your reference. Due to my frequent travels abroad, I am using the chat function in the app to communicate, as there is no available email for customer service, making it challenging to manage paper correspondence. Below are summaries of my interactions with Barclays representatives. \n\n1. Saturday, XX/XX/2024 Via Barclays App I reported that a balance transfer of {$1400.00} to my XXXX  had not been received, even though it was processed on XX/XX/XXXX. A representative named XXXX XXXX acknowledged my issue concerning the balance transfer and proceeded to check my account for further details. XXXX asked me to wait while she checked the details, thanked me for my patience, and the conversation ended there without a resolution. \n\n2. Tuesday, XX/XX/2024 Via Telephone Call Case Number : XXXX I called to report that the {$1400.00} transfer from Barclays to my XXXX account had not occurred. I requested that if the transfer could not be completed, the process should be reversed. I asked for an email contact, but it was not provided. Unfortunately, the representative 's name was not captured, but I was given the case number referenced above for future reference. \n\n3. Monday, XX/XX/2024 Via Telephone Call Case Number : XXXX - Talked to an operator : I explained that the {$1400.00} had not been credited to my XXXX account nor reimbursed to my Barclays account. The operator insisted that the transfer had been processed and that XXXX had received the funds. Upon my assurance that the funds were not received and not reflected on my statements, I asked to talk to a manager and she transferred me to another agent - Talked to an agent named XXXX : The agent XXXX reiterated that the transfer was processed and stated that the issue was out of his hands, explaining that it was now with the Settlement Department, which can not be directly contacted by email or phone by anyone, including agents. After I requested to speak with his manager, XXXX transferred me to another agent instead. \n- Talked to another agent named XXXX  ( ID # XXXX ) : XXXX created a new case for the issue new case number XXXX He informed me that as he is not a manager, he could not confirm our conversation via email. \n- Talked to a manager named XXXX ( ID # XXXX ) : XXXX echoed the previous statements, confirming that no one could send an email to verify the ongoing investigation or to follow up on the issue. \n\nThe series of calls ended without a resolution to the missing {$1400.00} transfer, leaving the situation unresolved and the funds unaccounted for in either of my accounts. As of today I have not received a resolution and it is frustrating to take time off and just be on the phone without the problem being resolved. Given that there has been no resolution for the past five months, I am concurrently filing a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) along with submitting this letter. This is to ensure this matter is addressed under regulatory oversight with the urgency and seriousness that it deserves. \n\nAttachment : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX",
