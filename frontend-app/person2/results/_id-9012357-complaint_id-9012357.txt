  "complaint_what_happened": "I filed the first dispute on XX/XX/year> regarding a {$5700.00} charge with the merchant, XXXX XXXX made on XX/XX/year>. After spending XXXX weeks of back and forth and repeatedly having communication delays from XXXX XXXX and them acknowledging they did not ship the item paid for, I filed to dispute the charge. On XX/XX/year> XXXX XXXX messaged asking me to confirm my shipping address and phone number, I confirmed they had the correct information and again confirmed I wanted what was paid for. On XX/XX/year> XXXX XXXX messaged that they were no longer shipping the item unless I canceled the dispute ( they already fake shipped once and I wasnt canceling the dispute just to start the process again ). On XX/XX/year> XXXX XXXX stated that they will need to wait for XXXX decision before sending me the item or refund, at this time they also refused any further communication with me since I did not comply with their request that I cancel the dispute. XXXX did not request any evidence for the dispute or allow me to submit any evidence when I opened the dispute, on XX/XX/year> I contacted XXXX via XXXX to ask if I can submit all of this evidence and they accepted it in the XXXX XXXX, the rep then tried encouraging me to cancel the dispute which meant I would need to start over if XXXX XXXX didnt ship the item even though there is a time limit for filing disputes, this seemed beyond unreasonable and a way for XXXX to get out of actually handling the dispute. I didnt hear back from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX until XX/XX/year> when XXXX XXXX finally sent me a message on my support ticket with a tracking number that they had shipped the item however confirmation with XXXX was they had *only* created a label. XXXX mins after this tracking was provided is when XXXX emailed me that they closed the case in XXXX XXXX favor with the reason being that the item was delivered or completed based only on the information just provided by XXXX XXXX, XXXX clearly NEVER confirmed the item was in fact delivered, completed or even shipped prior to closing the case which is evident by the tracking information that XXXXXXXX XXXX provided. I messaged XXXX XXXX back on XX/XX/year> that the label was created and nothing showed as shipped, I followed up on XX/XX/year> again that the label was only showing as created and nothing has been shipped. The item tracking number changed to shipped on XX/XX/year> but on XX/XX/year> the tracking updated to the package was recalled by XXXX XXXX, upon XXXX XXXX confirming the case was now closed and the funds unfrozen, XXXX XXXX requested XXXX bring them back the package ( another fake shipping scam ). XXXX states this recall directly on the tracking number that XXXX XXXX provided. I messaged XXXX XXXX another follow up on XX/XX/year> regarding the recall and was told they intentionally stopped the shipping because I filed a case, even though the case was now closed because they had agreed to ship the item. I filed a dispute again with XXXX, again providing more information to include the XXXX tracking itself showing XXXX XXXX did a fake shipping scam along with other proof that they acknowledge they took the money but didnt ship the item. On XX/XX/year> I contacted XXXX again requesting the dispute evidence to be looked at and that they can verify the fake shipping for themselves, they reopened the case and accepted evidence this time, I have continued to upload and send proof to XXXX throughout the case being reopened this time through the email link they emailed me but have heard nothing back from them. This should have long been either decided in my favor. On XX/XX/year> XXXX XXXX themselves admitting to the fake shipping scam and that they recalled the shipping AFTER XXXX sided with them before confirming it was delivered and stated they did it because I filed a dispute. Dispute was closed in their favor with them agreeing to ship the item on XX/XX/year>, the package was recalled by XXXX XXXX between XXXX and I filed the dispute to be reopened on XX/XX/year>, XXXX XXXX didnt respond for a week and then responded 4 days after the dispute was reopened using that as the excuse to why they fake shipped the item. On XX/XX/year> XXXX XXXX messaged that they couldnt send me the item or a refund without XXXX approval. XXXX XXXX last response to me is dated XX/XX/year> where they stated they already acknowledged and clarified that they did the shipping incorrectly but said again that XXXX is to be contacted as they are responsible for making a decision. XXXX XXXX claims repeatedly in responses how they cant send me the item that was paid for or give me a refund unless XXXX makes them and that XXXX is the reason for the delays but they fake shipped the item twice now. My card was unable to be used at one point due to this charge even though I paid on it, I have always had good standing on my card, there is no reason why this should continue to inconvenience me after all the evidence that has been provided including.",
