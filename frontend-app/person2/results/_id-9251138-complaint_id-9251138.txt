  "complaint_what_happened": "On XXXX I was scammed by a phone contact claiming to be XXXX XXXX XXXX, regarding my XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card through Barclay 's bank. I immediately called the Credit Card Customer Service number on the back of my card ( XXXX ) and was directed to another Customer Service phone number ( XXXX ) to report the problem and request a new card and number. I was assured that I would not be liable and that a new card would be sent out and would arrive in 2-3 weeks. When the card did arrive, I tried to activate it online, and was denied access because the *new* account was frozen due to a fraud claim. At that point I started calling Barclay 's trying to get the account unfrozen and to pay my annual membership fee ( {$89.00} ). This quickly turned into a game of \" XXXX '' and with my being told that I needed to deal with the Fraud Department . Each Customer Service rep gave me different numbers to call and different hours of operation. This is important because there is a 6-hour time difference between XXXX  and the East Coast of the U.S. At no time was I allowed to pay my outstanding balance. And, at no time was I allowed to speak with anyone who could unfreeze my account. A list of the phone numbers I was given and the departments I talked to is attached. There was no consistency of the information I was given, and all my phone calls have ended up rolling over to a main number. In the mean time, my credit rating has gone from XXXX in XXXX to XXXX in XXXX - all based on the information provided to XXXX XXXXby Barclays XXXX *. Then today I get a notice from Barclays that my credit card limit has been reduced from {$22000.00} to {$500.00} based on a report provided by XXXX, and again based on the information given them *by Barclays . *. I got a similar letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX \n\nI am at my wits end trying to get this fixed. I have made every good faith effort to pay my bill in full, but due to what seem to be process issues and errors on Barclays I am unable to do so, nor am I able to gain access to my accounts. \n\nAt first I was annoyed, but now I'm very angry. I'm feeling hopeless and helpless and at the mercy of a bank that simply doesn't care.",
