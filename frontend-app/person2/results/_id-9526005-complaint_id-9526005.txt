Upon reviewing my report with my loan XXXX over the weekend, I was alarmed to find late payments recorded for XXXX and XX/XX/year>. \n\nI am unsure how these late payments occurred, as I believe I made my payments on time based on the statements I received. It is possible that there was an issue with receiving or processing my monthly statements. \n\nI request the immediate removal of these late payments from my credit report. Given our previously positive relationship, I also ask for a refund of any late fees that were assessed due to these errors. Additionally, I believe I have been billed incorrectly under the provisions of the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) and other relevant statutes ( 15 USC 1666b, 1681i, 1692g ). \n\nI urge you to correct these inaccuracies promptly. I would prefer to resolve this matter without further delays or complications. I appreciate your attention to this issue and look forward to continuing our positive relationship. \n\nThank you for your assistance.",
