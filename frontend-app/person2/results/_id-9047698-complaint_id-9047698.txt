XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ( myself ) are the cardholders and we did not accept the charges. They refuse to do anything. We call every week and are told the same thing every week. We have done our own research and the airline charge was put on hold by credit card company and tickets were never used, but company never received their money- so they are in a sense trying to get double pay. We received mail from the insurance company with our address but someone else 's name ( assuming its the person who stole our information ). We have sent all this information to the Citibank via email and in letter format. They still refuse to do anything and are now charging us finance charges on the credit card we are refusing to pay. \nWe have used Citibank for almost XXXX years and normally pay our balance EVERY month.",
