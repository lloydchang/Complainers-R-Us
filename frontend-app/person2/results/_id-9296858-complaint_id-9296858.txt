On XX/XX/2024 I received a text message payment reminder from Synchrony Bank. I attempted to reply to the text but the system doesn't accept replies. Since it was late afternoon when I received the text, I called Synchrony Bank today, XX/XX/XXXX, to ask them if they received the check. They did not receive it. I checked my bank account and it did not process. They said to put a new check in the mail and gave me the address to send it. I asked them to waive the late fee, but they said they could not waive it because it was past the due date! They also said they gave a late fee waiver once before ( the same thing happened once before! ) Their bill says they can charge a late fee of up to {$41.00}. That is what they intend to do.",
