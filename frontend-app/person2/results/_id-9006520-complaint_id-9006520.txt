After entering all my info for the transfer everything seemed typical. On XXXX I saw on Chase bank that a transfer had been initiated to XXXXXXXX XXXX and all still seemed fine. However when that transfer had not posted to my XXXXXXXX XXXX Credit Card by XX/XX/XXXX, I grew concerned so I called XXXXXXXX XXXX and was told there was no transfer in process and they recommended I call Chase. I then immediately called Chase Bank and explained that a transfer for {$6000.00} was posted to my Chase account but the XXXX XXXX has no record of it. That's when I learned the wrong account number had been paid. The account was still with XXXX XXXX or so I was told but was a completely different account number from my own. During that conversation the representative said it looked like a possible banking error and the situation had been elevated. After not hearing anything back I called Chase Bank again on XX/XX/XXXX to get an update. They said then that I would need to wait 14 business days while the process was handled. I figured they would fix the problem and the transaction would get reversed during that time, it did not. I then called again on XX/XX/XXXX to get updated on the process as the 14 business days had lapsed. I was then told the situation had been elevated to a team with no internal line and that the process would take up to 30 days from my initial call on XX/XX/XXXX to be resolved. Those 30 days lapsed on XX/XX/XXXX and I have still yet to have the situation corrected or be communicated with by Chase Bank. I have records I whom I spoke with on my 3rd call on XX/XX/XXXX but not the previous calls.",
