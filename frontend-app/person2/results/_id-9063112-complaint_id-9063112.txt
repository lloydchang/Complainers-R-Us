  "complaint_what_happened": "A national tire company, XXXX XXXX uses this bank for finance options when needed for tire purchases. The bank is XXXX. After paying my bill, I was taken aback by the bank prompting me to enter my entire social security number on their bill pay website. I called and made this point clear a couple days after the due date with a phone representitive. I was told the balance was {$41.00} and that payment would \" zero out '' the balance on my XXXX XXXX  card. I was charged {$37.00} for the \" delinquent '' payment. Subsequently, a second fee of {$37.00} was added to the balance as I just assumed I was done with my payment obligation. My latest statement ( XX/XX/year> ) shows a balance of {$76.00},, due to XXXX late payments of {$37.00} each on my balance of {$41.00}. This debt was paid in full acording to the offshore Comenity customer service representative. I had no reason to even open the last paper statement. I just assumed my balance was paid in full. I was shocked to see my account charged XXXX late fees and interest accrued.This nesesitated a phone call to XXXX where, I was prompted to enter my entire social security number. It's imporant to note, Comenity blanks out all but XXXX digits of the account number on their paper statements, therefore prompting me to enter my SS #. After more than an hour on the phone with XXXX representatives from XXXX, all declined to waive the excessive fees and the XXXX XXXX APR interest rate. My obvious frustration and anger, for good or bad, prompted XXXX to block my number for paying my \" surprise '' balance of late fees and interest via the customer bill pay phone line. I canceled my card with the fifth customer support representative in my marathon phone session. So, my card is cancelled by my request. When I got to my home phone I was further agrivated by these charges and called to make a payment on my balance of fees and interest. The company has blocked my number from further communication with Comenity. I'd be more than displeased to pay my balance but would with small increments till the {$76.00} was paid. XXXX says no payment other than the minimum payment would be accepted. I am aware that there is a loud voice from consumers to banks to \" be fair '' with outrageous fees. In my estimation, XXXX simply doesn't need or can't justify this kind of money, AFTER my purchase has been paid in full. Since my account has been canceled, can I not simply make any payment option I choose to pay these fines? \nI'll write my representatives in XXXX to shine the light further on business practices by banks that harm real people, like me. Please afford me any options that XXXX be available and thank you, XXXX XXXX",
