I realized from the domain of the page which is XXXX that it was a false purchase since the real domain is XXXX from the official page, on the same day, XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted the Zip application to stop the transaction immediately while the payment was pending, they limited themselves to telling me to wait 13 days and that they couldn't do anything even if I sent them screenshots of the real and fake page, they even urged me to contact with the scammer, which the ftc agency for reporting fraudulent sites does not recommend and I let them know, I contacted the customer support chat of the real page by sending them the same screenshots as zip and they verified that it was not their page and I sent them the capture with the conversation to zip, ignoring them and only limiting myself to saying that I would contact the seller, not even giving me options. I have screenshots with their customer service of them and even an email reporting the fraud on their page that supposedly should be attended to within 48 hours which has already passed more than 48 without a response from them, which gives me to understand that they do not want to reverse the payment even so when I let them know that it was a fraudulent transaction, since the XXXX I I have contacted them and they have refused to give me a solution until the next payment. My bank did a dispute with this company for the same problem because they refuse to give a Solution",
