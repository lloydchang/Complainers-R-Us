There was another charge that was blocked in the amount of {$1200.00}. My account was credited. And then in XX/XX/year> the charges were back on my credit card. I called the fraud department and they did an investigation and said the merchant had all of the information and that I made the purchases. They wouldnt even tell me what I ordered. They said they would mail it to me. Once I received the documents I went to a local Santander Branch in XXXX, PA and the Branch Manager, XXXX XXXX is assisting me. However the charges have not been credited to my account and now Im being charged late fees. Every time I call for an update, there is none. He said he had to go above to get assistance for this issue. Meanwhile Im getting calls, emails, text messages because I havent made any payments on these fraudulent charges. I didnt know what else to do and thats why Im contacting you. Evidently I ordered many pairs of sneakers and had them shipped to an address in New Jersey.",
