All my other credit cards would charge a late payment fee but no interest because it was still within the statement period. When I look at my statement closing XX/XX/year>, the interest was charged not on the XXXX original balance, not the XXXX of a balance after my payment on XXXX, not the balance of XXXX which is net of the returned items, but rather on XXXX. So they charged XXXX in interest and after communication with their customer service group was to expect more interest to be charged for the next month statement. So as it currently stands, ( XXXX XXXX unpaid balance ) XXXX days late X 365 days = 754.68 % interest rate. That's before they charge some other arbitrary interest charge for the next month.",
