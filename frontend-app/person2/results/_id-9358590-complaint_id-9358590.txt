The link to get card number now errors out and I can not get back to the screen. I call Citi and am told no other opportunity can be provided if the screen errored out. Now I can not make my purchase now and they recommend I wait 7-10 days for the physical card. I now have a new credit card processing but did not get the offer I click on for the amount off and miles. I am now trying to have the account closed by the bank before it is even sent out to me since I now have no need for it.",
