Immediately, I responded back indicating that I had not applied for credit. Additionally, I noticed that my XXXX Score was lower than usual. In obtaining a credit report on XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed a new account had been opened XX/XX/year> from Barclays Bank Delaware. Without my knowledge, a Jet Blue World Elite card, with a total credit line of {$19000.00} had been opened. I immediately contacted the company to notify them that I did not apply for the credit card. Eventually, I was connected to their fraud department. I was informed that an investigation would be conducted. Also, that I would not be held responsible for the {$7000.00} purchase made on the card. I was also, informed that a followup letter would be mailed, verifying the closure of the fraudulent account. To date, I have not received any correspondence from the company. Understandably, I am upset that a credit line of {$19000.00} could be established without proper verification to begin with. Furthermore, I have spent countless hours in an effort to avoid further fraud, and/or misuse of my identity. At a minimum, due to their negligence I am paying a monthly fee of approximately {$25.00} for added credit card monitoring. An expense that should be offered to me free of charge by the credit card company responsible for opening this account to begin with.",
