They lower based on pulling your credit report and not your history with them. Then they have no customer service to address it and you're told you have to wait for a letter that only states it's based on your credit report. They are doing business based on what could possibly happen, not on your customer history. Very unfair business practice. Why even give the card if you aren't allowed to use it to build history?",
