I had a special registration code that I needed to use to sign up for this credit card. I followed through on my end by spending the required amount within the time period. I received XXXX miles into my XXXX XXXX account on XX/XX/XXXX, but I did not receive the additional XXXX due to my airlines account. I called the credit card company to dispute this, and a case number was created on XX/XX/XXXX to investigate my complaint. I followed up with the credit card company 3 times to get a status update, and I was informed each time that the credit card company acknowledged I was due XXXX total bonus miles, and that I hade met the requirements of the {$4000.00} spend within 90 days, but the company could not figure out why only XXXX miles were deposited into my airlines account. The representatives informed me to wait until my next billing cycle on XX/XX/XXXX to see if the additional XXXX miles were deposited into my airlines account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I confirmed that the additional XXXX miles were NOT deposited into my airlines account. I then called the credit card company again, and spoke with a supervisor named XXXX, who informed me that the credit card company had sent me a formal letter on XXXX indicating that the investigation into my complaint had concluded and the outcome was that I was owed XXXX miles but did not know when these miles would be deposited into my airlines account. XXXX gave me a confirmation # of XXXX to follow up. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, I do not see the additional XXXX miles that is owed to my airlines account, and I am filing this complaint with this agency to resolve the matter. This is false advertisement on the part of the credit card company, and the company has gone to acknowledge that I am due the additional miles, and yet they will not honor their part of the agreement.",
