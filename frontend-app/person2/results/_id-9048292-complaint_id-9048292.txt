I have accumulated XXXX points on my card. According to Bank of America 's marketing materials, website, and mobile app, these points can be credited against travel expenses paid for with the card. The terms and conditions define travel as follows : **How Your Travel Credit Works : ** A travel credit is applied as a statement credit to your account to offset travel and dining purchases from qualifying merchants in these travel or dining-related categories : airlines, hotels, motels, timeshares, trailer parks, motor home and recreational vehicle rentals, campgrounds, car rental agencies, truck and trailer rental, cruise lines, travel agencies, tour operators, real estate agents, operators of passenger trains, buses, taxis, limousines, ferries, boat rentals, parking lots and garages, tolls and bridge fees, tourist attractions and exhibits like art galleries, amusement parks, carnivals, circuses, aquariums, zoos, eating places and restaurants, drinking places, bars, taverns, cocktail lounges, nightclubs, discotheques, and fast food restaurants. Purchases from some merchants that provide travel or dining-related goods and services will not be eligible for a travel credit, such as in-flight goods and services and duty-free airport purchases. Points may be redeemed for a statement credit to offset qualifying travel and dining purchases that occurred within 12 months prior to the date of redemption, limited to the most recent XXXX qualifying purchases. Each point redeemed for a travel credit is worth {$0.00} ( XXXX points = {$25.00} ). \n\nI used my card to pay for a hotel stay on XX/XX/year>, amounting to {$3000.00}. I attempted to apply the rewards to this stay, which should have resulted in a credit of {$1700.00}. However, after a lengthy phone call with Bank of America, including escalation to three different managers, my request for the credit was declined. They stated that the hotel did not have the proper MCC ( Merchant Category Code ) and therefore, they could not apply the credit. I offered to provide a copy of the hotel bill clearly showing that this was for travel, as described in the terms and conditions, but they refused to consider it. \n\nI then visited my local branch and spoke with the credit card department to raise my issue again. The department noted my previous call escalation and once again denied the credit. \n\nI am deeply frustrated by this experience and believe that my request for the travel rewards credit should be honored as per the terms and conditions provided by Bank of America. I request that this matter be reviewed and that the appropriate credit be applied to my account. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely,",
