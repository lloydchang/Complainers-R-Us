  "complaint_what_happened": "On XX/XX/year> I was notified by Chase that a plane ticket I had purchased had a change in itinerary and I needed to go online to accept the changes. When I went to see what the changes were I saw that they had changed my return flight ticket from XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. The flight arrival time was the same ( XXXX ), but the departure got moved approximately two hours earlier. Both original and the updated flights were departing from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and arriving in New York XXXX. The updated flight was showing a total duration of 1 hr, although the original flight was direct and lasted approximately 5 hours, and the updated duration should've been 7 hours 10 minutes. This led me to believe that they had changed the flight to include a layover, however where the layover was was not displayed, it was just showing that I now had a \" one hour flight '' from XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX, with a departure time of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and an arrival time of XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. \n\nI booked the plane tickets through Chase 's travel agency that is a free benefit associated with the credit card. \n\nI called Chase 's travel agency on XX/XX/XXXX to try and resolve the matter and was on the phone for over an hour without a successful resolution. \n\nThe agent told me that she could also see that I now had a layover, but couldn't or wouldn't tell me where the layover was. At the time of booking the original flight I paid extra to ensure that the flight would be direct, as my husband has to apply for visas in many countries and we didn't want to risk a layover, and I have a physical XXXX that makes travel difficult and so it was worth it to us to pay extra for a direct flight. \n\nChase went back and forth between not admitting that it was not a direct flight, and saying that if there was a layover they were unable to tell me where it was and I needed to call the airline. When I called the airline the airline told me that they could not give me any information about the flight as I had booked through a third party, Chase. \n\nFinally Chase offered us the same flight we had been originally booked on, but on an earlier date, so we are now on a flight that departs on XX/XX/XXXX and arrives on XX/XX/XXXX but is direct. I do not find this to be an acceptable solution, as we again paid extra to fly on the date we had originally booked which was a Sunday and Sunday flights are much more expensive than Saturday evening flights. Chase maintained that the issue was with the airline ( but would not tell us why the flight had been changed or confirm that we had a layover ) and would not allow us to rebook our flight with a different airline without cancelling the entire flight, paying cancellation fees, and then booking a new flight entirely which is not a reasonable solution and would've been much more costly.",
