  "complaint_what_happened": "In XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a Bank of America XXXX  XXXX business card card. I paid off all of my balance in a timely fashion. In XX/XX/XXXX account renewed and they had charged me an annual fee of $ XXXX. I did not pay that amount in XX/XX/XXXX as I wanted to closed the account. So I called Bank of America customer service in XX/XX/XXXX and discussed with the agent on the phone to close my account and waive the annual fee and associated interest charges. The agent assured me that he will cancel the account, cancel the annual fee as he was closing the account and would waive the associated interest charges. The annual fee was approximately $ XXXX {$75.00} with an {$8.00} interest charge. Instead of closing the account and refunding manual fees as it was closing the credit card completely, Bank of America kept the account open and sent it to collections without my knowledge or any forewarning. \n\nI have not received a single piece of mail or email communication discussing the possibility of sending my account to collections for any unpaid balance. I was shocked to find out earlier today that they counted stayed open and the balance was unchanged even though the agent told me last year that the annual fee and the interest charges would be removed from my balance. They have also not sent me any communications of an outstanding balance on this account since my last conversation with them last year when I had believed they closed the account. \n\nThis morning I had spoken to Bank of America customer service numerous times as well as the collections department and they remain unhelpful in this matter. They insist on me paying an annual fee and interest on a card that they should have closed last year when they assured me they would. I have not used this card or this account in the past 9 to 12 months. \n\nThis is very fraudulent behavior by Bank of America. They have kept an account open without my consent after assuring me that the card would be canceled and the associated balance would be removed. The current balance does not include any purchases that I had ever made on that card. It is simply the annual fee/interest for not paying the annual fee.",
