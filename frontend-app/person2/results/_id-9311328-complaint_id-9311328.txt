  "complaint_what_happened": "On XX/XX/year> I was fraudulently charged {$2000.00} by a individual who was supposed to only charge {$750.00}. He did not complete the work, and instead charged my card {$2000.00}. After I noticed the charge, I texted and called him, as I just assumed it was an honest mistake. He had already blocked my number. I filed a dispute with USAA for {$1200.00}, as I had intially agreed to pay the individual {$750.00}. In hindsight, I should have disputed the entire amount as the scammer didn't complete the work we agreed to. That same day USAA credited my account. I assumed all was well. On XX/XX/XXXX I saw that my credit card had been re-charged the {$1200.00} that I had disputed. Turned out, they had uploaded documents to my document section saying they needed more information. They didn't call me, didn't email me, didn't message me, nothing. Since I didn't know they needed more information, they didn't receive a response and they closed my dispute claim. So I called the help line and re-opened the dispute claim. They didn't state what additional information they needed, just that they needed additional information. There is no way to talk to the actual fraud investigative team, you can only upload documents to the case and hope they see it. I wrote down the entire situation on paper and took a picture of that ( there is no where to add notes or communicate with the investigative team ), I took a screenshot of the call logs where I tried to call the individual who scammed me, I took a picture of the text message where we agreed to {$750.00} and where he did not respond after I sent him a screenshot of the {$2000.00} charge asking him if he made a mistake. I took pictures of the incomplete work that the individual performed. I uploaded all these photos/screenshots to the case. On XX/XX/XXXX, the case was again closed with the following : Weve completed our investigation of your dispute and determined that the information in our records was deemed insufficient. As a result, our decision stands. You remain responsible for payment of this transaction and any associated fees. This concludes our investigation. Again, no information on what records I could provide that would be \" deemed '' sufficient. I called the help line on the morning of XX/XX/XXXX and asked if there was any additional information I could provide that would meet their requirements. The representative didn't know. At that point I asked to file an official complaint with the Office of the CEO. The representative did not know how to do that, but found some documentation and supposedly submitted a form so that the USAA complaints team would call me back. While I'm hopeful, but doubtful, about the complaint process, this entire process has been ridiculous. USAA puts the burden on the member to do all the work and investigation on fraudulent charges. The do not communicate, do not give details, and do not side with members. USAA does not protect its members from fraudulent charges on credit cards, but instead holds them liable.",
