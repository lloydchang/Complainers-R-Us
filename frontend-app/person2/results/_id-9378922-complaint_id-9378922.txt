I have been a loyal Barclays client for nearly a decade, maintaining an XXXX FICO score and a spotless payment record. Recently, I encountered a troubling situation with Barclays promotional offers. \n\nWhile attempting to pay my bill online, I noticed XXXX promotional offers : XXXX for a XXXX or XXXX card, and another for a 3.99 % APR on purchases. Due to technical issues with the website, I called Barclays for clarification. During this call, I was informed that they could waive the annual fee for my existing titanium card. However, it was not clearly disclosed to me that accepting the fee waiver would cancel and delete the other promotional offers I was evaluating. The poor phone quality on their end exacerbated this issue. \n\nSubsequently, and in real time while I was discussing the gold and XXXX card offers, they disappeared from the website. When I inquired, the representative stated that I was no longer eligible for any offers for at least 90 days and provided me with a legal address to file a complaint. He further stated there was no guarantee if and when I would receive these offers again, however. The representative was unable to rectify the issue, despite calling me back several times due to the poor phone quality on Barclays end. \n\nLegal Basis for Complaint : XXXX.
