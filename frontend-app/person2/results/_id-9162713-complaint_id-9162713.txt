It was a break in when I was away from apartment a couple of days. There were three charges on my Discover Card on XX/XX/XXXX. \nXXXX {$360.00} ( denied but merchant claims they were responsible and knew about the fraud charge and didnt demand cash from suspect ) XXXX  {$320.00} ( credited ) XXXX {$1900.00} ( will not work with me- said its a credit card company issue ). I have now provided police report, affidavit, identity theft report, proof from airline i didnt travel on the flight, emails from merchant, copy of new passport and evidence I was still in XXXX the beginning on XXXX. Discover acts like this case is not important. I call and receive different information every time I call. The process is slow because Discover only takes faxes and us mail. My faxes were not all received or bad quality. I used an online service because I dont have a fax machine or used one in over 10 years. I thought the online would be easier then running to XXXX XXXX or some places for providing faxes. Last time I faxed was expensive because was a shipping and mail company. Plus, my faxes were long. 16-20 pages. But after spending all of XXXX trying to work with Discover and send faxes I got frustrated because they didnt have my information in their computer. In XXXX I decided to send two certified mail so I knew they had the information. They then confirmed receiving it but no phone call. They claim to have reviewed but made same decision. I know for a fact a proper review never happened because the reviews were quick. No communication with merchants about the case. XXXX day review and denied the charges still. I need this to go to the local state government in Nevada or to the federal government for help getting this case handled properly and with some urgency. I sent XXXX final package that was received Friday XX/XX/XXXX by Discover. I called today and was told it will take one or two weeks to upload my information. Why? \nEnclosed is the police report they requested. I am told that is all that is needed. I dont believe or trust Discover now. I have over {$300.00} in expenses just providing information in this case. This should not be necessary. Even when they fix these charges I will have lost {$300.00}. \nThis is urgent and are fraud charges from 6 months ago. I dont have two weeks for Discover to get my information into their computer and then start a review. I need consumer protection and consumer rights help in this case. Can you please assist me work with Discover? They dont seem to care or take this matter seriously. Please dont close this case after Discover replies. We need a monetary outcome in the case. It needs to stay open until we get resolution from Discover and charges credited back to me. If there is another option in fighting Discover please let me know.",
