The customer care was extremely unhelpful and didnt fix the issue, and now they reported me as delinquent on the bureau for the junk fees that they have been charging on my card. The extent of the fees accumulated which include : interest, late fees, minimum interest charges now amounts to {$35.00}. None of this amount is from purchases, when I reached out them, asking for the explanation they are refusing to take my dispute and offering to remove the \" late fee charges '' if I pay {$20.00}. This is atrocious and to think they will ruin my credit score as well for this being reported as a past due on my card. I need both these charges as well as the delinquency removed from my report. When I reached out to the customer care, they are calling it a collection call and only asking if I will pay in the chat overand over without making any attempts to resolving the issue",
