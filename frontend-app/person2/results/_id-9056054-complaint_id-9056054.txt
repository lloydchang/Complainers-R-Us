So I applied, but upon checkout, the {$200.00} wasn't deducted. So I contacted Southwest before I completed my ticket purchase to ask why. I was told I would see the {$200.00} credit when I got my first statement, it was not immediately deducted from my purchase. That was completely unclear in the ad. However, when I got the first statement, there was a yearly fee charge but no {$200.00} credit. So I called Southwest and they said I had to have used the credit card to purchase my flight in order to get the {$200.00} credit. That was also completely unclear information in the ad and was different from what I had initially been told. Furthermore, I was told that I would have had to have used the credit card to purchase a ticket within 3 months of getting the credit card in order to receive the {$200.00} credit. That was completely unclear on the ad as well. I've been doing things like this for a long time so I always read the fine print, and this was absolutely unclear and intentionally deceptive advertising on Southwest 's part!",
