Interest will make me over limit. \n\nI am requesting the following : XXXX Financial compensation in the amount of {$1000.00} by way of interest charge credits. I need to have more available credit and the sudden and drastic decrease is going to very negatively impact my credit score. 2- Going forward, I would like Citi to ask me if I want credit line increases, rather than giving them and snatching them away randomly. I'd like to provide consent for an increase so that they can not pick and and choose when to destroy my credit score. No other credit card that I have ever had has done this and it feels very unethical to make such sudden and drastic changes that so greatly impact customers.\n\nThis has happened before, and Citi provided an interest credit. I am asking for the same, however more than one month 's worth. Previously, I did not notify the CFPB but because this is a repeat incident without a worthy explanation from Citi, this should be reported.",
