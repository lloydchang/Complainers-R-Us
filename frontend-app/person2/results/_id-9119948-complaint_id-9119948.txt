Despite numerous communications with your customer service representatives and supervisors, my issue remains unresolved, and I feel that I have been repeatedly misled. \n\nOn XX/XX/2024, I spoke to a supervisor named XXXX regarding the status of my sign-up bonus. Prior to this, I had communicated with other customer service representatives on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/2024, all of whom confirmed that I had a sign-up bonus offer on my Gold card. They assured me that I would receive the points once I hit the minimum spend of {$6000.00}. \n\nAfter meeting the required spend, I did not receive my points. Subsequently, I was told by another representative that I did not have an offer. This is particularly frustrating because I clearly remember signing up for the XXXX card due to the banner advertising the sign-up bonus. \n\nWhen I spoke to Supervisor XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, he assured me that he would follow up with the agent and that I would receive my points once I met the {$6000.00} spend. Despite meeting the spend requirement, my points were never added. \n\nI reached out again on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to follow up, speaking to XXXX XXXX on the latter date. XXXX assured me that the points would be added manually when my statement closed on XX/XX/XXXX. This, however, did not happen. \n\nEach time I reach out to customer service, the regular agents can not see the supervisor notes and provide conflicting information. I have had to repeatedly request to speak to a supervisor and explain my situation from the beginning every time. This lack of communication and consistency has caused significant inconvenience and frustration. \n\nI am deeply disappointed by the way my case has been handled. I feel that my concerns have not been taken seriously, and I have not been provided with a timely resolution. I demand an urgent review and immediate crediting of my sign-up bonus points for the Amex XXXX XXXX. The inconvenience I have faced due to this issue is unacceptable, and I expect swift action to resolve this matter. \n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this complaint. I look forward to your immediate response.",
