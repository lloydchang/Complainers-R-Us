I called Wells fargo immediately in an effort to find out where the funds were sent. I was met with \" customer service '' agents who could not provide any information which was quite alarming. They instructed me to open a case so that they could research what had occurred. This case was \" resolved '' a few hours later via an email stating I am responsible for the funds. There was no answer to any of my other questions which further alarmed me.

I spoke with XXXX in the executive office who said she would escalate this case and try to get it assigned faster. As it stands, I still have a {$12000.00} outstanding balance with Wells fargo that I am responsible for. I came to them because of their advertisement and now have double the debt with no real help or information. I am concerned what they will do with my personal information seeing how they are handling me in this specific situation.",
