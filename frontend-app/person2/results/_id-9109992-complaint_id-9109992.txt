Capital One lied in their response. I attached their response letter to this case. I also attached proof of their lie. They claimed that they are unable to provide a refund because I did not respond by their deadline by XX/XX/XXXX. This is false. They emailed me another link to upload my response on XX/XX/XXXX to allow for me to respond. I responded that same day on XX/XX/XXXX. I attached the relevant email from Capital One that confirms this. I uploaded my information pertaining to this case to their system with the link that they provided in their email. \n\nOriginal complaint : \" I was charged by mistake from the merchant, XXXX, without any provided services on XX/XX/XXXX. I never signed up for recurring charges. I contacted the merchant on XX/XX/XXXX, to cancel the service. I noticed the issue after a review of my bill. I contacted the merchant on XX/XX/XXXX, and the merchant agreed that it was in error. The merchant explained that they are not able to issue a refund for charges of {$240.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, because they changed their merchant services to a different one since the charges were made. They advised that I make a credit card dispute for a chargeback to get a full refund. My credit card company, Capital One, asked me for more information about the charge. I completed their questionnaire and mailed it to them. They never received it and closed my case. I called Capital One afterwards and explained that they should have received my questionnaire. Capital One emailed a link for me to upload my questionnaire and reopen the case. I submitted the information to Capital one via their emailed link. Afterwards, Capital One denied my claim for full refund for the charge on XX/XX/XXXX, because they told me that it was over 180 days. The other charge on XX/XX/XXXX, is still being reviewed by Capital One. The charges are fraudulent and in error. The merchant wants to issue a refund, but they are not able to. I submitted evidence to Capital One of my cancellation of the service on XX/XX/XXXX, and the merchant 's agreement to issue a refund, but not being able to on XX/XX/XXXX. Capital One has the only access to the XXXX dispute process to allow for a refund and they are unwilling to cooperate. '' I attached all of the relevant information that was attached to the previous case. Please reopen this case and assist in my complaint against Capital One. Their response is not true and should not allow for this case to be closed.",
