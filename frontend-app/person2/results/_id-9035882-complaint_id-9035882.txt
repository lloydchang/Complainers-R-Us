I proceeded to transfer about {$2600.00} to my credit card under this promotion. When I attempted to pay off the interest-bearing portion the bank stated they could not, separate or identify that dollar amount and I would still pay interest on any remaining balance which includes what I transferred. I believe not only was this misleading, but I am also not receiving the promised promotion of XXXX interest until XX/XX/XXXX. My ultimate concern is that this practice is done for everyone who accepts a balance, transfer promotion, ultimately deceiving credit card holders by charging interest on the balance transfer. I also believe that I should not be penalized for paying off my interest-bearing portion before I pay off my promotion.",
