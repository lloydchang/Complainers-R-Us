  "complaint_what_happened": "On XX/XX/year>, I received an email from Citi Costco Visa Card, hereunder refereed to as ( \" the Company '' ), informing me that I would be receiving my earned Costco credit card reward certificate of {$420.00} ; which was supposed to have been issued to me sometime that same month via email. Then on XX/XX/year>, my Citi Costco Visa card account was closed at the company 's discretion with no further explanation given. Up to that point my account with the company was in very good standing, no history of non payment and balances owed had always been paid off timely each month. Often time payments were made way ahead of their due dates. \n\nEven after the account has been closed, I continue making timely payment that are due each month as my goal is to always pay off what I owe. After waiting several months to receive my {$420.00} rewards certificate that was promised ; I realized it never came. On XX/XX/year>, I decided to contact the company inquired as to why I had not receive my rewards due to me. That was when I was told by the representative that those rewards would NOT be issued to me due to the fact that my account was closed on XX/XX/year>. This news was shocking and seemed very unfair and deceptive to me as a consumer, particularly when I had always been a loyal customer of the company. \n\nI am not upset of the fact that the company decided to close my account and did not want to provide an explanation as to why. I understand the company have that right and at their own discretion may decide to termination the relationship for any reason at any time. \n\nHowever ; the consumer have the right to get back what is owed to them. The reason the {$420.00} rewards were there was because I'd earned them by shopping throughout the year and spending my good earned money fair and square. If the company decided to discontinue the relationship at that point, I would understand any earned credits that month may be forfeited, but to actually forfeit the entire amount is practically unfair and is downright aggressive and abusive. \n\nAll I ask is for the reward that I had earned fair and square to be issued to me during the time while my account was opened and prior to it's closed date of XX/XX/year>. \n\nTherefore, any assistance the bureau could provide would be greatly appreciated as the authority who can intervene in the matter at this point. \n\nSincerely,",
