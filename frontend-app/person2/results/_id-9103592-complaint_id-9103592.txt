When I called customer service to inquire about the interest charge I was informed if I wanted any of the payments I submitted over the last 12 months to be applied to the promotional balance I needed to call them after submitting a payment to tell them I wanted the payment applied to the promotional balance. I was told I could avoid the interest charge if I paid the promotional balance in full ( {$1000.00} ). I was then informed when a payment is received the payment is applied how they deem fit. I was under the impression the payments I was making over the last 12 months were being applied to the promotional balance since that was the very first purchase made with this card and the reason this card was opened. I have done this with other store credit offers and have never had this experience.",
