  "complaint_what_happened": "I am moving and opened the Costco Citi card as we have many appliances and large purchases from Costco. The store offers special deals for caardholders. I have an XXXX credit score and household income over XXXX, yet have a fairly small limit {$7500.00} compared to other cards in my wallet ( ex. Amex over $ XXXX ). That's is fine though, and I've simply been paying off the card in full after each transaction to continue to free up available balance for large Costco purchases. \n\nToday XX/XX/year> I was unable to pay a Costco 3rd party installation team with my card, despite my card balance being XXXX. My credit union checking account was debited 2 days ago, meaning I do not have access to the cash, nor can I cancel the payment. Further investigation revealed my available balance reflecting {$0.00}. I called and was informed Citi had placed a seven day hold on my payment. I talked with multiple reps and was unable to get a credit increase, cancel my payment, pay additional ( I offered this despite balance being XXXX ). They're just going to place a hold on my {$7500.00} for 7 days, meaning I'll have to cancel my appointments and lose out on deals. I may have to pay cancellation fees. This is unethical, and I believe Citi is enacting this policy in an effort to sit on cash to boost their deposits and cash on hand for shareholders. No one could explain why they chose to place a hold on this payment when I've made 4 payments already. \n\nI feel like Citi should be investigated for this policy. I fortunately have access to cash and other accounts but I feel like this policy is predatory. I can't imagine the harm it would cause many American families to lose access to $ XXXX for a week, penalized for pre-paying their card. Don't we want people to use credit cards and pay them off immediately. Costco is positioning this card as a way to help families get the best value during their move, but Citi is using it as an opportunity to lock up needed deposits and cause serious harm to consumers. \n\nI work in banking and the explanation I got was intentionally deceptive. I feel bad for the representatives I spoke to who are just reading their script, and I wonder how they can sleep at night knowing they are seperating families from their cash without cause or reason.",
