  "complaint_what_happened": "On XXXX I made a purchase of {$3000.00} from XXXX with their store branded credit card. The purchase was of a sofa, a dresser and smaller decor items. I received the decor items on XXXX which had a combined value of {$62.00} less any taxes due. Being larger items, the sofa and dresser required a bulk shipping agent to deliver. Their total combined value was {$2300.00} less any taxes due. In addition to the {$2300.00} for the furniture, XXXX levied a {$410.00} shipping and handling fee for the use of the bulk shipping agent. In total, {$2700.00} is the pre tax amount charged on my store branded card. For the next 2 months, the bulk shipping agent would open delivery window dates for the furniture to arrive to my door. On 4 separate occasions I would select a date within their window, take a day off from work to prepare only for the shipper to cancel delivery. Over the course of two months I contacted XXXX XXXX separate times to have the issue resolved and each time they were XXXX helpful. Fed up, I contacted XXXX on XXXX and was able to escalate the issue far enough to where a representative, in writing, confirmed the cancellation of the remainder of my order and stated that a refund will be placed on my store branded credit card once the company received their shipment. This led me to file a transaction dispute with Synchrony Bank, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX for their store branded credit card, on XXXX. Since I have never taken ownership or possession of the furniture items, and the fact that XXXX, in writing, had agreed to cancel the shipment and issue a refund, I felt I had no obligation to continue making payments. On XXXX, Synchrony declined my dispute. I had it reopened on XXXX. It was declined a XXXX time on XXXX. I had it reopened on XXXX. It was just declined for a XXXX time on XXXX which has led me to the CFPB. How can I be responsible for paying on an item for which I have NEVER had possession of?",
