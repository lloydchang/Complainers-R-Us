I am writing to formally dispute charges on my credit card ending in [ XXXX ], dated [ XX/XX/XXXX ]. The transaction in question involves the purchase of airline tickets through XXXX XXXX. \n\nOn [ XX/XX/XXXX ], I made a reservation for airline tickets using my Citi credit card. However, upon receiving the confirmation, I realized that the tickets were booked for the wrong dates. Realizing the mistake promptly, I contacted customer service via phone to rectify the error and request a change in the travel dates. \n\nDuring the phone conversation, I was informed by staff that changing the dates was not possible, which left me in a predicament as I needed to travel on short notice. Faced with no other option, I had to make alternate arrangements through another agency, incurring additional expenses. They blocked the tickets, and I called, they later said they were unable to refund. \n\nFurthermore, during the interaction with customer service, I was asked multiple times to provide sensitive information such as the CVV number of my credit card via email. This request raised suspicion, as it seemed fraudulent to provide such information after the transaction had already been processed. \n\nGiven the circumstances, and after careful consideration, I decided to dispute the charges as the service provided by the company did not meet the expected standards. Attached to this letter, you will find evidence of the email correspondence where staff requested sensitive information and proof of the incorrect booking. \n\nAs a loyal customer of Citi, who regularly utilizes this card for business purposes, I am disheartened by this experience. Throughout our history of transactions, such issues have never arisen before. \n\nIn light of these events, I kindly request a refund for the disputed charges to be credited back to my account at your earliest convenience. I trust that you will investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate action to rectify the situation. \n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to a swift resolution. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",
