On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Citibank falsely indicating that I did not provide the requested information and they were closing the investigation. I called Citibank and requested the investigation be reopened and for them to actually read the information I provided.

Obviously, that was not possible as XXXX was not offering to credit my account.
