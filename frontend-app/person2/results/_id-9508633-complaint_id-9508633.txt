It seemed to have good ratings, but I should have been suspicious with any product that claims to be \" like magic. '' On their website, they specifically state that there is a money back \" risk free '' trial guarantee. Based on this, I felt that it would not hurt to try out the product since, with a money back risk free trial guarantee, it would cost me nothing if the product did not work. The items arrived on XXXX XX/XX/year>, and within a couple days I contacted customer support and notified them that the product was not working, and that the devices were leaking onto my wooden floor and my carpet. They were responsive, and sent out a replacement for some of what I bought. These items did nothing, and released no scent and had no impact on my cats. Within the trial period, I contacted the company and requested a refund. I was told that the \" risk free '' money back trial guarantee actually was not as was advertised. Instead, I would have to pay return shipping and a {$9.00} fee. I stated this was not what it said on their homepage or in the ads they have everywhere on the internet. They then offered me a XXXX  % refund. I contacted Synchrony bank and disputed the charge as the items were not as described ( they did not work ) and that their money back risk free guarantee actually was false and deceptive. Synchrony bank placed the XXXX charges in dispute and credited my account. I sent to them proof of their advertising as well as the e-mail they sent saying that I it wasn't truly risk free or that I would get my money back. On XXXX XX/XX/year>, Synchrony recharged my account. When I called, I asked if they had received my evidence and I was told no, they had not. However, they then appeared to find it in the system and the representative did some research and did see how what I claimed was correct and the dispute was reopened. I asked if I needed to send anything more, but was then told no, they have everything. On XXXX XX/XX/year>, I received a digital letter than said the dispute was reopened and I would not be responsible for the amount in dispute. On XXXX XX/XX/year>, I called Synchrony again, and informed them that the temporary credits had not posted and I was concerned that I would end up having to pay for the amounts in dispute. On that call, I was told to wait 4 days, and the dispute would be resolved in my favor and I would receive a permanent credit. I waited XXXX  days and, on XXXX XX/XX/year>, I reviewed my billing statement, and I was having to pay the amount that was in dispute, a direct contradiction of the letter I received on XXXX XXXX and no permanent credit had been posted as I was told would happen from the call on XXXX XX/XX/year>. This also violates my rights as a card holder in that Synchrony specifically states that, while the investigation is underway, they will not try and collect the amount in dispute. I requested to speak to a supervisor on XXXX XX/XX/year>, but was told none were available after the representative reiterated that I would not be responsible for payment, but did not fully understand that I was explaining to her that my account currently shows that I am responsible for the fraudulent charges.",
