  "complaint_what_happened": "I am applying for a credit card XX/XX/XXXX, which I was approved for. On XX/XX/XXXX they indicated that I had 90 days to spend {$1000.00} to get {$200.00}. However the credit card does not arrive for over XXXX weeks so I cant use the credit card until its activated. I can not activate the card until I get it, so its really XXXX months and XXXX weeks not 90 days I have to spend {$1000.00}? XXXX this is misleading. My question to you is it responsible lending? As of this filing, I still do not have the credit card so I can not fulfill the XXXX dollars yet. When I called customer service, I asked will the 90 days be extended when I received the card and they indicated no. I understand they will not know when I receive the card but if they say in their email, it will take this amount of time to receive the card. Should they factor that into the 90 days?",
