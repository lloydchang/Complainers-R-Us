In getting XXXX to correct the error, XXXX then charged and refunded my Citi Visa card. On XXXX XXXX the vendor charged XXXX CAD to the Citi Visa card ( {$850.00} ). On XX/XX/2024 the vendor refunded XXXX CAD to the Citi Visa card ( {$850.00} ). This refund was an error ( should have been made to the other credit card ). However, there is a difference of {$5.00}. Essentially I am paying Citi {$5.00} for a service I never received. I contacted Citi to get the transactions to match in USD and was told I needed to contact the vendor and ask them to refund me the difference as a courtesy because of the difference in exchange rates between the USD and CAD. I believe Citi could do the same thing since the vendor sent them the exact funds for the transaction. Thank you for your assistance in resolving this issue.",
