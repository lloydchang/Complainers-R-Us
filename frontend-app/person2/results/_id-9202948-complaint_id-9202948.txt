Specifically, it has come to my attention that PenFed Credit Union has accused me of opening my account with a fake Social Security number, alleging it to be a CPN ( Credit Profile Number ), which is categorically false. \n\n# # # Incident Details On XX/XX/XXXX2024, at XXXX XXXX, I spoke with an agent named XXXX on a recorded line at phone penfed number ( XXXX ) XXXX. During this call, XXXX assaulted my character by falsely assuming that I used a fake Social Security number to open my account. Furthermore, XXXX claimed to have pulled up my public records and stated that I have been convicted of fraud before ( ( which is not legal XXXX NEED permissible purpose by law to contact third parties with my private or personal information. Your offenses amount to Aggravated Identity Theft pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1028A. You have knowingly transferred, possessed, or used, without lawful authority, a means of identification of me, which is a felony punishable with up to 2 years of imprisonment, in addition to civil liability. \n. This statement is not only false but also highly disrespectful and humiliating, especially as it was made in the presence of my co-workers and employees. \n\n# # # Allegations of Fake Social Security Number and CPN These allegations are not only incorrect but also highly damaging to my reputation. I have always provided accurate and truthful information to PenFed Credit Union. Your assertion that I used a fraudulent Social Security number is baseless and has caused undue stress, financial inconvenience, and harm to my personal and professional standing. \n\n# # # Violation of Federal Laws Your actions in this matter appear to violate several federal laws designed to protect consumers from discriminatory and unfair banking practices : 1. **Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) ** : PenFed Credit Unions baseless allegations and subsequent actions constitute discriminatory practices, which are strictly prohibited under the ECOA XXXX \n\n2. **Civil Rights Act of 1964 ( Title VI ) ** : As a financial institution receiving federal funds, PenFed Credit Union is prohibited from engaging in discriminatory practices based on race, color, or national origin.\n\n3. **Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act** : The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) enforces laws against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices ( UDAAP ). The wrongful closure of my account based on false allegations falls squarely within these prohibited practices.\n\n4. **Regulation E ( Electronic Fund Transfer Act ) ** : This regulation provides protections for consumers who use electronic fund transfer services. The unauthorized closure of my account without proper investigation or evidence violates these protections.\n\n# # # Defamation of Character Furthermore, the unfounded accusation of using a fraudulent Social Security number constitutes defamation of character. This false statement has tarnished my reputation, caused significant emotional distress, and has the potential to affect my future financial transactions and opportunities. The additional false claim of a past fraud conviction, made on a recorded line, further exacerbates the harm to my character and reputation.\n\n# # # Demand for Immediate Action In light of the above, I demand the following actions be taken immediately : 1. **Reopen my account** without delay and restore all account privileges.\n\n2. **Issue a formal apology** for the false allegations and any public or internal statements made regarding my account and character.\n\n3. **Compensate for any financial losses** and damages incurred due to the wrongful account closure and defamation of character. \nXXXX. **Address the conduct of the XXXX, XXXX, to ensure such disrespectful and humiliating behavior is not repeated with any other customer. \n\nFailure to address this matter promptly and satisfactorily will leave me no choice but to pursue legal action. I am prepared to file a lawsuit against PenFed Credit Union for defamation of character and violation of the aforementioned federal laws. \n\nPlease consider this letter a formal notification of my intent to seek legal recourse if this issue is not resolved within 14 days. \n\nI look forward to your prompt and favorable response to this serious matter. You can contact me at ( XXXX ) XXXX or XXXX to discuss this issue further. \n\nSincerely,",
