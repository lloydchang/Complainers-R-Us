  "complaint_what_happened": "As I testified at the recent XXXX hearing, I wanted to get a credit card with airline miles with more destinations than the one I had. I read the reviews, weeded out paid for advertising, compared rates, and read all the online disclosures. I even called customer service to be sure I understood some vague terms. With that, I opted for the Chase XXXX card. It was offering bonus points if I spent a certain amount in the first two months. I did all of that. I tried to book a trip to XXXX and later to XXXX XXXX. I started off on the domestic XXXX site, put in my trip, clicked on the use points option, and was rerouted to the XXXX website to complete my booking. For the first time ever, I saw that there was a fee to book the XXXX XXXX flight to XXXX. It was + {$450.00} CA. To see how much I was saving, I went to XXXX to see how much airfare would cost outright. I found the same United flight-same day, airport, and time-for {$420.00}. It was cheaper not to use my points. The same happened when I tried to book my flight to XXXX XXXX. I called Chase, which transferred me to XXXX. When I asked why the website transferred me from US to XXXX, he replied \" we're a XXXX company, what do you expect? '' When I pointed out for purchase I would stay on the US site, he repeated that statement. I asked him to explain why I was transferred if that would cause a fee. He said \" I could explain it to you, if you want. Do you want me to explain it to you? '' I asked him to explain since that was the point of my call. With a deep sigh for his troubles as a call center employee, he explained in essence that since I was \" buying '' the airfare with points, I had to be transferred to the XXXX website for the transaction, and while there, I had to pay a foreign transaction fee. I don't have historical conversion figures, but does {$420.00} US convert to {$450.00} CA on or about XX/XX/2024? These points and rewards offered by Chase and XXXX are completely illusory. I spent the money required for points that I will never use as it will always cost more than buying the tickets outright.",
