However the bank continue to accept the word of the merchant that the transactions was legitimate. The bank also claimed that we waited too long to report the incident, But our position is that the transaction was no longer legitimate when we became aware that they had no intentions on buying our property, It is that the merchant deceived us by delaying his purchase of buying our property to make time to reporting a complaint null and void.

XXXX XXXX  was able to recoup {>= $1,000,000} for us and that is why A Boutique claims we have a balance. Now A Boutique is keeping our money in total of {>= $1,000,000} this includes another credit card I used to pay off the contract. We are paying for their timeshare for which we do not own. Since then I had to do several balance transfers so my credit would not go bad and this has caused me a financial burden. At the time I issued my credit card these transactions were legitimate but when I realize that they were scamming me and committed fraud it became illegitimate. \nthanking you XXXX XXXX",
