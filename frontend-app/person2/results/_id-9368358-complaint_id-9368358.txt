  "complaint_what_happened": "On XX/XX/XXXX, I accidentally overpaid my Bank Of America credit card bill by an amount of {$5100.00} through XXXX bill pay service. On XX/XX/XXXX I requested a refund of the {$5100.00} and Bank Of America said they would issue a refund. After several weeks of not seeing the money in either my XXXX or my checking account, I received a letter from BOA dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating that they had successfully completed the refund. I called Bank Of America to find out why I hadnt seen the money yet and the representative told me that refunds could take up to 30 days for the money to appear in my account, so I waited. \nI called back after the 30 days had passed and the representative told me that they would conduct an investigation and get back to me. I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating that Bank Of America had concluded their investigation and that they successfully completed the transfer on XX/XX/XXXX. \nSince that time Ive called BOA monthly if not weekly to follow up, each time Im told they will escalate my case and each time I only ever receive a letter claiming that they have concluded their investigation and that XXXX successfully transferred the money to my XXXX account and that I need to pursue this with XXXX. \nWhen I call XXXX to follow up, they claim that there is no record of this transfer into my account. They went on to explain that when a transfer is successfully completed, XXXX issues a transaction ID number, both to the sender and to the receiver ( Ive never received a transfer ID # ). XXXX said that they need this transaction ID # in order to trace any transfer made into my account and without this transaction ID # theyre unable to help me further. \nIve requested this transaction ID # from Bank Of America on numerous occasions and have been told that since XXXX handled the transfer, Bank Of America has no access to that transaction ID #. \nIn a more recent call to Bank Of America they shared an internal reference # with me and urged me to see if XXXX could use this to track down the transfer. I called XXXX but the reference # didnt yield any new results. \nA manager for a local Bank Of America branch recently helped connect me with a supervisor at Bank Of America who revealed that the transfers were actually done in 3 parts- one for {$5000.00}, one for {$100.00}, and one for {$11.00} ( the same way the payments were made to my credit card ), amd each had a transaction number associated with it. I thought that these were the numbers I needed for XXXX but they also turned out to be internal Bank Of America reference numbers as they were 23 characters long and XXXX transaction ID # s are only 20 characters long. \nOn two occasions, I requested that Bank Of America reverse the transfer and on both occasions they were unsuccessful. \nAt this point, both institutions are telling me that too much time has passed and that theres nothing they can do to help me, each pointing the finger at the other, insisting that the other is responsible for the mistake and that I need to take it up with them.",
