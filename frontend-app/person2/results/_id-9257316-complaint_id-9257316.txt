  "complaint_what_happened": "In XXXX XXXX I paid off the CC for XXXX and verbally requested Catherine 's CC which is owned by Comenity be closed. At which time I was informed it would be done. My mail is being forwarded and I am in the process of relocating. In XXXX, I opened a bill to find that I had accrued late fees, interest charges on {$3.00}. When I closed the account in XXXX, I had a XXXX balance. When I called the company, I was informed that I could not actually close the account with a balance and the balance was a carry forward for the time between the bill cycle and when I paid it off. However, when I spoke to the CSR in XXXX, I was told it was a {$0.00} balance and closed. I was not notified that my account could not be closed because of a balance. In XXXX when I called to find out why I was still receiving bills, it was explained to me that my account was not closed as requested because of the {$3.00} and interest and late charges were being applied. I requested that all be credited and again I was informed no problem. After that was completed, I asked the CSR to close the account. As of XX/XX/XXXX, my account was closed. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and I am right back where I started in XX/XX/XXXX but with a closed account and an accruing balance. I called and spoke with both a CSR and Supervisor and was told that because the account is closed, they can't reverse the charges. My question is how can a CC have past due, late, and interest charges when it was {$0.00} by Comenity Bank and closed? In XXXX I was told that an account can't be closed if it has a balance. So we have a contradiction here. 1 ) It was either closed with a XXXX balance, 2 ) I was lied to the first time and it should have been closed in XXXX of XXXX because it can be closed with a balance, 3 ) The charges can be reversed on a closed account. Someone is not telling the whole truth. When I call the Comenity bank number the automated reply gives a XXXX balance, XXXX. Again, a discrepancy in the system.",
