I indicated I did not authorize the charges, and that they were fraudulent. I was instructed they would be changing my credit card, and assured they were taking care of the charges. I was not told I needed to follow up on any online site to ensure my chargeback went through, I assumed because they were obviously fraudulent. \n\nThe charges were indeed reversed and I went about my business. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I was troubled to find out that the charge for {$190.00} had been reversed and I was again charged for this fraudulent sale. Apparently there was a \" message center '' that was used to contact me about additional information. This should have been unnecessary - as the paperwork was obviously fradulent and used a fake email, claimed that I was using a pakistani IP address to make the purchase, and invented a fake email for me. \n\nDuring the time that this \" message center '' request was made, I had logged into the citi.com website and logged in to make a payment. At no point was I given any indication that I needed to follow up on my fraud chargeback. In fact, from what I can see the message center is inaccessible from the mobile citi.com website that I use for the Costco credit card to pay bills. No attempt was made to call me or send me a letter in the mail. \n\nI called and explained, again, that I had never purchased cosmetics, ever, on this card, that the information used for my email was fake, and that I did not authorize any purchase. The individual I spoke with told me they would reopen the investigation. That seems to have ocurred, but my charge is still showing on my account. I was not given a timeframe. \n\nI emailed that same day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to the email address provided for chargebacks with a good deal of information on why the \" evidence '' supplied by the criminals in this matter should never have been accepted given some obvious problems ( IP address in XXXX, fake email address, didn't actually list a product, etc. ) I called today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and was told that they would not remove the charge from my account during the investigation. The invidual claimed it would take up to 60 days to get a resolution. I pointed out the dubious nature of the evidence provided and the rep. from citibank security refuesed. He also refused to escalate my complaint to a supervisor. Supposedly I will get a call but I don't trust it will happen.",
