  "complaint_what_happened": "On XX/XX/XXXX I noticed a charge on my account I didnt make. I called the bank on that day to dispute the transaction. I spoke to an agent named XXXX. I told her that the payment in question was for my car insurance payment which I made with a different card at the same bank. I have XXXX accounts with Wells Fargo bank i.e. a checking account and a credit card. I was charged for the same amount {$120.00} on both accounts. I told the bank that the insurance company should have only charged the checking account and that the credit card payment should be voided or cancelled. XXXX said fine and that she would take care of it. When I checked my credit card statement on XX/XX/XXXX it was still showing the payment of {$120.00} on XX/XX/XXXX as being completed and not pending. When I called the bank back that day, I was transferred to the Claims Department and spoke to XXXX. When I explained my problem to him after waiting 45min, he said the only thing he could do was wait for the payment to post on my checking account ( It already did ) before he could dispute it and that would be on Friday XX/XX/XXXX. That would mean Id have to wait a total of nine days before they would investigate it. Most banks just put a hold on your card until they are able to resolve the problem and they dont keep the item on your account or show it as pending. This waiting 9 days before anything can be done is just inconvenient. The fact that one agent said it was taken care of and the other one said it was not is very confusing and sounds like double talk. Please investigate and issue any violations if possible. Thank you.",
