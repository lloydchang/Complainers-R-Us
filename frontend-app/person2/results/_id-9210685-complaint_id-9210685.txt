Every other bank removes a pending authorization the moment a transaction is processed and posted. The account manager I spoke with on the phone, XXXX, said that this is an issue with the merchant and that they double charged me on the two days, and only one of each transaction posted with the remaining double still pending.

They are trying to blame the vendor, who has verified that they DID NOT double charge me. I am not being given a clear answer as to why I have to wait for pending transactions to fall off even when they were already processed and posted. All they can do is blame the vendor who didn't do anything. I was also told its something with the \" online ordering process '', which makes no sense.
