  "complaint_what_happened": "On XX/XX/year>, I was in XXXX XXXX, XXXX on vacation. I ate at a restaurant where two men approached me, claiming to be employees. I asked for a menu, but they said there wasn't one and asked what I wanted. I ordered shrimp with rice and a passionfruit juice. When I tried to pay with my US Bank XXXX credit card, they said their system was down and we needed to go to a nearby merchant to process the payment. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>, I discovered they had charged me {$300.00} for the meal. Assuming it was an overcharge, I submitted a dispute to US Bank. They categorized it as a mistaken overcharge and sent paperwork for me to complete. After filing the dispute, I researched and found this was a common scam at that beach. \n\nI collected news articles and trip reviews about similar scams and submitted this information to US Bank on XX/XX/year> ( file attached ). \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, the charges reappeared on my account, so I called US Bank. The representative asked if I had received a resolution letter, which I had not. She said the charge would be credited back, but it never was. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>, I received a letter stating my dispute was denied due to insufficient information ( file attached ). I called US Bank again and was told they would request to reopen the case and recategorize it from incorrect amount to fraud. However, nothing happened, and the charge remained, accruing interest. \n\nI followed up on XX/XX/year>, and was told the case had not been reopened or refiled correctly, but another request would be made. \n\nOn XX/XX/year>, I called again and found the case still hadn't been properly handled and was still not reopened/recategorized. I spoke to a customer service supervisor who explained : 1. Dispute representatives can not remove charges or reopen cases ; they can only request case managers to do so. This had not been explained to me, so I thought my case was being processed.\n\n2. Case managers can't receive inbound calls, even from dispute representatives ; requests are submitted electronically and no follow up information is available to the dispute representatives.\n\n3.I would have \nto wait for a call back from a case manager supervisor. Previous call attempts were made when I couldn't answer, and no messages were left. I explained that as a full-time worker and student, I can't always answer calls. The representative told me to prioritize the call but could only give a window, not an exact time.\n\nI am stuck in a loop of inaccurate information, dead ends, red tape, and dysfunctional processes. I feel US Bank allowed me to be scammed, and I plan to end my business with them. I recommend the CFPB investigate this and advise consumers to avoid their financial products.",
