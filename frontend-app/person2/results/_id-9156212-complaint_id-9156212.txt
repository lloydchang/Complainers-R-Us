  "complaint_what_happened": "XXXX XX/XX/2024 : I opened up a time payment plan offered by Chase Bank which allowed me to set monthly payment of {$1000.00} per month over a 12 month period interest free. I called to inquire if the plan could be paid early without penalty. I was only advise that I would have to pay the TOTAL amount owed on the plan. I could not apply additional payments solely against the plan. WHAT I WASN'T ADVISED WAS THAT ALL REFUNDS FROM PREVIOUS PURCHASES WOULD BE APPLIED TOWARDS THE INTEREST FREE PLAN AND NOT MY CREDIT CARD PURCHASES. THIS INTEREST FREE PLAN HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM {$12000.00} TO {$5000.00}. IN TWO MONTHS.\n\nI only realized what was happening after a second billing cycle which showed my interest free plan had been reduced by several XXXX of dollars. I call Customer Service. The bank has records of my calls about my issue. The first representative stated my issue would be referred to the escalations department. Last week I spoke to supervisor who assured me it was being looked into. Only, during these conversations, was I advised re : the credit card refund policy to the plan. I was also advised to expect a follow up in writing. \n\nOn XXXX XX/XX/2024, I made another called to the bank and was passed onto a person in the escalations department. He reiterated the plan policy and flatly stated nothing could be done to fix this issue. He gave me the address to write a letter to Chase Card Services. I wanted the funds moved from the plan to the credit card purchases making up my balance. \n\nI called again later in the afternoon. I asked the representative where -in writing- is the policy advising the consumer that all refunds to my credit card would be applied to the plan first and NOT back against the original purchases.. I also asked where can I see the itemized list of the refund transactions applied to the plan. I only see total amounts reducing the amount owed on plan. My rewards points of over {$1300.00} was cashed in and I do not know if the moneys were applied against the plan. \n\nWhen I set up the pay over time payment plan, there was no accompanying documentation. I question if this is a fair practice and even fraudulent. To avoid paying interest on my credit card, I have had to pay a larger interest saving balance. It contradicts the reason why I set it up the plan in the first place. Certainly not in the best interest of the consumer.",
