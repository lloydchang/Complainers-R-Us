  "complaint_what_happened": "XX/XX/XXXX Citizens Credit Card Fraud dept called me 2X. One was a message asking me to verify purchases made. I called them back @ XXXX. I Told the agent I did not make any of the purchases ( 6 purchases totaling {$1600.00} between 2 different stores, XXXX in XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX in XXXX XXXXmade hours apart from each other ). She asked if I had my card in my possession. I called her back after checking with my 2 daughters- we all had our cards. The credit card was cancelled by the agent and a new card was issued. I told her my daughter and I were at work that day and my other daughter XXXX lives in XXXX \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I received a letter in the mail telling me I was responsible for the charges of {$890.00}. They took off a charge of {$720.00} for a coat ( I was told by the agent who originally called me on the XXXX that was purchased ) that the charge didnt go through. Im assuming thats what caused the fraud alert to Citizens??? \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX about the letter and to deny that we did not make those charges. I was asked if we had our cards in our possession and did I file a police report? I told her yes ; we do have our cards and why would I need to file a police report? She told me to report something stolen from me. How would I have known to do that? I asked to be connected to the claims dept ( the dept responsible for the charge against my card and me ) and was told I couldnt call them- but they could reach out to them, and they would call me back. I was told I would receive a call back in 3-5 daysRECEIVED NO CALL BACK. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX to ask about my claim and inform them no one called me. They again asked me if I had my cards in my possession and I said yes. They asked if I filed a police report! I said no, I didnt think I would need to, I just wanted to speak to claims. The agent said to me, I see here that you have two other people using your card and that one of them lives in XXXX? I said yes. She then inferred that just maybe she did make the purchases and I just didnt know about it? So extremely unprofessional AND I didnt appreciate the attack on my daughters moral code. I requested a call back from claims. I was told I would receive a call back in 3-5 days RECEIVED NO CALL BACK. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX After being asked two times by two different agents if I filed a police report- NOW I did. I thought this may help them see we didnt make those charges. I filed with the XXXX XXXX Police NH. Case # XXXX with police XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX \n\nXX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX called me to inform me he spoke to the manager of the XXXX store ( XXXX XXXX ). He looked up the charges for that date and stated the purchases were made with XXXX XXXX using either a cell phone or a XXXX watch between the hours of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. The items were all mens items. He said they dont ask for ID when people pay with that form of payment. Video hours are only saved for XXXX hours so no visual record of who made the purchases. The officer called my daughter and asked her about any chance if someone could have used her card to make the purchases and she said. No, I keep it locked in a safe in my bedroom because I never use it unless I go abroad. Officer XXXX asked my daughter if she would be willing to go to the Concepts XXXX XXXX store because he couldnt get a phone number for the place, and she lives in the next town over. She found the store ( she said it was hard to find, just a little door between two stores with not much signage and spoke with the employee at the register. He looked up the CC # and found it in the computer. He also said it was paid by XXXX XXXX He gave his number to my daughter. As she was going home, he called her and told her that his manager knows the guy that came in and he is known to be a thief on XXXX XXXX and that he filed a police report against him! My daughter called me and XXXX XXXX with all this info. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX to dispute a {$29.00} late charge fee and an interest charge of {$14.00} on the pending charge card. I was told not to worry about it-it would all be taken care of by Citizens when the dispute is finished. I told them that I was worried about my credit being damaged in this process since NO ONE will call me back about the claim, and I paid the minimum due of {$59.00} to not have it go against my credit! I requested a call back from claims. I was told I would get a call back in 3-5 days..RECEIVED NO CALL BACK XX/XX/XXXX I called Citizens back @ XXXX to inform them that a police report has been filed and an investigation is happening. I gave the Citizens agent the police report # and asked for a call back from claims. She gave me a back-office alert # XXXX by XXXX. She said I would receive a call back in 3-5 days. RECEIVED NO CALL BACK. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX XXXX from claims called me and left a message ( I was at work with patients ) from phone # XXXX. In his message he said his boss asked him to call me and see if I had all my cards in my possession ( ICOULDNT BELIEVE IT! ) and if I didnt, then he could help me. I called him back at the # he called me from and was disconnected every time I asked to speak to a rep! I did this 3X thinking it was my mistake, but it wasnt- the service promptly hangs up on you telling you that you should call back at another time! \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I called the number XXXX and the same thing happened again. I then called XXXX and told her claims had called me and I wanted a call back. XXXX sent a message to XXXX because he did call me back. I told him we do have our cards and I asked him WHY do I get asked that each time I call. He said they have it as a credit card chip that was used at the purchase sites. I told him the police called the store and it WAS NOT a card that was used at all- that it was an XXXX XXXXXXXX using my stolen info! I told him I would get the police report in a few days and how could I get it to him? He told me he would tell this info to his boss and call me back in a few days. RECEIVED NO CALL BACK. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I called fraud dept XXXX and asked for a call back from claims. The agent told me I would receive a call back within 3-5 days. RECEIVED NO CALL BACK. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX After receiving no call back from Citizens I called again and asked for a call back from claims management. Told agent NO ONE has called me back for a month. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX Received bill for purchases with a {$40.00} late fee and a {$14.00} interest charge. \n\nXXXX I went to XXXX branch of Citizens to see if they could connect me to someone in claims to help me and they put in a request and just heard it was denied because it wasnt a high enough problem to deal with and denied any help to me.",
