I asked 2 representatives on XXXX XX/XX/year> for a copy of the initial credit report pulled, initial contract we went into with the {$5000.00} credit limit, a copy of the credit report pulled on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX and a copy of the decision letter. I was told that those items were system generated and that they could not send me any copies, I asked why and was told that any correspondence sent by AMEX is system generator and that AMEX has done nothing illegal by reviewing my credit to make a decision to increase or decrease my business credit. When I spoke up and said that I had not given written or verbal permission to run my credit I was told that it was a summary review and in the initial credit card agreement I agreed to allow AMEX to review and run my credit for updates.",
