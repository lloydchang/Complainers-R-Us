Chunk:
the contract states a line of credit that is fdic insured in the amount of { $ 250000. 00 }. with this account set up and established it's not subject to a credit report it states in the contract a line of credit which entitles me to more than { $ 3000. 00 } and i don't except just { $ 3000. 00 } it's not enough. whatever happened to the rights that i'm entitled to under the bill of exchange act is that not irrelevant here at all. i'm never letting it go because if i was white i wouldn't be having this problem at all i'm xxxx
