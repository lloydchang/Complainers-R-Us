Chunk:
xxxx xxxx i had filed initial complaints with : consumer financial protection bureau id xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxxxxxx xxxx xxxx id xxxx xxxx credit cards xxxx and xxxx i am refiling both complaints as barclays is comporting itself with continued reckless negligence engaging in continued harassment by unjustified blocking and disabling of access to and use of said accounts failing to make good on contractually agreed upon benefits when i opened the accounts. they blocked the accounts again. they were unblocked for about xxxx weeks only in which time i had made $ xxxx in purchases on both accounts ( $ xxxx total ) and i immediately paid all off all $ xxxx debt 100 % and bank received payment. then i made a purchase for a measly { $ 18. 00 } to buy a by a bus ticket while traveling and they blocked the accounts again causing me to be stranded with a small nephew at airport in xxxx. i called customer security and they can only unblock the account ( suspicious as a result of { $ 18. 00 } charge! ) only when i can be reached at the home phone that i left at home in california. this is abuse beyond imaginable of a solid trustworty and high credit worth customer with xxxx balance. them having set a password on my account does not help at all. insane abusive / incompetent customer security. my accounts are blocked yet they had charged me { $ 75. 00 } fees and i am unable to use the account 99 % of time since account opening! the bank itself is one big fraud and abuse. customer security at this bank is one unimaginable abusive fraud towards reliable high credit worth customers. never ever rely on this bank or their cards when travelling. they left me stranded with nephews at airport again. horrible abusive bank. they see i had made purchases for $ xxxx xxxx each card and i paid all off immediately last week yet they blocked my accounts over subsequent charge of { $ 18. 00 }!! and only way to unlock is they demand i pick up my land line phone at home that i have no access to while travelling.
