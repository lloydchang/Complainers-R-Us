  "complaint_what_happened": "I have had a Bright XXXX XXXX account open for a few months ( opened around XX/XX/XXXX ). I noticed no improvement in my credit score and random sums of money coming out of my bank account. I attempted to look into it on the app, but the interface is so poorly designed its impossible to tell whats going on ( one screen says you have {$25.00} available to withdraw, then you go to withdraw and it says you only have {$15.00} available things like that ).\n\nMy money seemed to just be disappearing into the app without any benefits. When I had to close my primary funding account, XXXX, around XX/XX/XXXX, I couldnt get it to delete/disconnect from the XXXX app. Nor could I get my secondary account, XXXX, to delete or disconnect all as I tried to connect my new account, XXXX. I was attempting to remove the old accounts and connect my new one ( XXXX ) so I could transfer any money out of Bright and then cancel the Bright account and cut my losses.\n\nAfter numerous conversations with support chat, I was told on XX/XX/XXXX, We would like to inform you that due to XXXX policy the funds [ on your Bright card ] can only be transferred back to their source account from where it was withdrawn. I explained that original funding account was closed and that was not possible. They responded, Are you trying to withdraw the Bright XXXX funds, I can help you. I said yes ( again ), and then they told me they would release my money back to me only if I sent them, via unencrypted chat support message, my new account number, routing number, ID document, and bank statement. I explained this was unsafe and I could get my identity stolen this way and that anything like this should be done through a secure platform like XXXX. They said it was standard and that I could email it if I was uncomfortable ( which would be no safer ).\n\nI asked why I could not just connect my new XXXX checking account via XXXX as I had with my other accounts. They responded, Because, Bright uses XXXX only to connect checking accounts and credit cards. Rest all procedures and documentation, Bright does by itself. We have a specialized team for them who will verify the information once you have shared it with us. Once verified, the funds are sent back to the non source account. This makes no sense to me, as I was able to connect my other two previous accounts and cards safely via XXXX. \n\nThat same day, I asked support how much money I had spent on the account/app ( as there is no way to tell from within the app ) and they were not forthcoming about it. Initially I was told only a {$50.00} security deposit. When I pressed further, suddenly, another charge was found {$60.00} for a membership I never signed up for! And my bank statements show even more charges than these. \n\nI have screenshots of all chat conversations with support as well as copies of my bank statements. I have reported Bright to the XXXX XXXX, and also plan to report them to my State Attorney General. I would greatly appreciate a full refund of all money I have spent/invested into this app/company in what I now clearly see is just a scam to defraud people and take their money and ruin their credit scores.",
