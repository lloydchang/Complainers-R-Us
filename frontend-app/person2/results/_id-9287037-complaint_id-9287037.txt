I reported it immediately to the credit card company. A few days later, agent called and asked if I have card in my possession ( I do ). She informed me that all transactions were \" card present ''. I told her they are fraud, and pointed out to suspicious pattern described below. She hanged up. Few days later i received a letter denying my dispute. When I called, they told me that the charges were declined because transactions were \" card present '' with chip used. I reiterated these were fraud and asked to reopen My complaint is : * Wells Fargo denied my report of fraud charges without attempting to investigate. I told them before that I have card in my possession and transactions are fraudulent. They ignored it. Simple XXXX search shows industry reports that fraudsters have been copying cards and fraudulently making chip transactions * Transactions are clearly following suspicious pattern : -- All but XXXX are from XXXX stores -- They occur about once a day -- They are all ~ {$500.00} or slightly less than that -- They are from different XXXX stores -- XXXX TX, XXXX TX, XXXX TX, etc -- These card present transactions happen when i did other, legitimate card present transactions in different locations far far away ( I see them on my statement ) -- I never used any of theseXX/XX/XXXXstores, and normal people don't make daily {$500.00} transactions in home improvement stores all around the country. \n\n* They did not try to do further validation that I told the truth : - They ignored all patterns above - Receipts have to be signed. Store records will show that the signature is not mine - XX/XX/XXXX records customers. One can ask video records and show this was not me - My cell phone and other records will show that I was nowhere close to these stores and was in a different part of the country, no one from XXXX asked me to provide any of these. \n\n* Wells Fargo declined my request without due care, and did not give me any provisional credit. I believe this is a violation of XXXX as an unfair and deceptive practice. \n\nI demand Wells Fargo to uphold the XXXX for fraudulent transactions.",
