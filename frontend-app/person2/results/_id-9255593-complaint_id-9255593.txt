  "complaint_what_happened": "I recently moved to a new home, and decided to buy all new furniture. As a part of this process, I visited the Pottery Barn store in XXXX XXXX, FL, where the Sales Associates and the Designer that I was working with recommended applying for the Pottery Barn Key Rewards Visa since it had a limited time offer of 10 % back in rewards for the first 30 days at Pottery Barn, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX & more, and I was planning to make a large purchase. Shortly after, I went home and applied for Pottery Barn Key Rewards Visa through Capital One on XX/XX/year> and received instant approval. The email confirmation of the approval from Capital One included the following note confirming the aforementioned offer : \" LIMITED TIME! DOUBLE REWARDS : Earn 10 % back across XXXX brands for your first 30 days. '' I then returned to the same Pottery Barn store on XX/XX/year> and worked with the same Designer in store to place an order for all of my furniture on the same day. I, together with the Designer, ended up placing an online order with Pottery Barn in the amount of {$24000.00}, an online order with XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$440.00}, and also made an in store purchase with Pottery Barn in the amount of {$470.00}. To reiterate, all the purchases were made on XX/XX/year>, well within the first 30 days of applying for the Pottery Barn Key Rewards Visa, and paid for by my new Pottery Barn Key Rewards Visa. Since then, all of the aforementioned charges have been posted to my Capital One Pottery Barn Key Rewards Visa totaling {$21000.00} from the online Pottery Barn order and {$470.00} for the in store Pottery Barn purchase, and I have paid off all of these charges in full. The only charges that are yet to be posted include a backordered item from Pottery Barn in the amount of {$1100.00} and the XXXX XXXX order in the amount {$440.00}. I have also subsequently canceled one item from the online Pottery Barn order since it was backordered, but the charges for that item never posted. To summarize, Pottery Barn has charged a total of {$22000.00} to my Capital One Pottery Barn Key Rewards Visa to date, so I was expecting to receive 10 % back in Key Rewards, amounting to {$2200.00} since the entire order was placed within 30 days of applying for the Capital One Pottery Barn Key Rewards Visa. This does not include the charges for the backordered item from Pottery Barn in the amount of {$1100.00} and the XXXX XXXX order in the amount {$440.00} that are yet to be posted, even though they were paid for on XX/XX/year> so I am expecting 10 % back on those as well. However, I have only received {$1100.00} back in Key Rewards to date, which is closer to 5 % back rather than the advertised and promised 10 % back, and the aforementioned cash back also includes rewards on {$1900.00} in other purchases that I have made on groceries and restaurants that would have given me {$79.00} in cash back at the 4 % back rate for these categories. In conclusion, Pottery Barn and Capital One still owe me approximately {$1100.00} in Key Rewards for the Pottery Barn charges totaling {$22000.00} that were posted to my Capital One Pottery Barn Key Rewards Visa to date. This again does not include the charges for the backordered item from Pottery Barn in the amount of {$1100.00} and the XXXX XXXX order in the amount {$440.00} that are yet to be posted, even though they were paid for on XX/XX/year>. I have attempted to address this issue directly with both Capital One customer service and Pottery Barn customer service, however, they kept refusing to address this and Capital One kept instructing me to contact Pottery Barn and vice versa. Neither of the two would take accountability and action to resolve this and grant me the missing Key Rewards cash back. Each time I called, the customer service representatives would give me conflicting information including that I am not eligible for the 10 % back in Key Rewards, that the 30 day intro period lapsed when my order was placed, that the stated limited time offer did not exist, or that the Pottery Barn charges were yet to be posted. If any of this is correct, it means that Pottery Barn and Capital One have been engaged in false and misleading advertising, and using deceptive practices to lure in customers.",
