  "complaint_what_happened": "Account with Lowes Synchrony total balance owed of XXXX was paid online XX/XX/XXXX and minimum of {$30.00} due by XX/XX/XXXX. My bank XXXX notified me that XXXX identical payments from Lowes synchrony were hitting my account on XX/XX/XXXX early am. I called credit card services and they saw my payment of XX/XX/XXXX and a duplicate payment XX/XX/XXXX that I did not make. They couldnt help me with that erroneous duplicate payment so suggested I contact my bank. XXXX suggested a stop payment on XXXX and waived the {$36.00} fee. Friday I called synchrony and both payments were stopped. Called XXXX and they apologized for their mistake and suggested we cancel the stop payment since its only able to be done on an amount and both were the same. Also I transferred another XXXX into this account since its not my primary checking account and I dont leave much of a balance. The next week lowes synchrony showed I owed XXXX the original amount and a late charge. I paid both immediately. The next day they closed my account because of two returned payments. I called customer service and XXXX said if XXXX would fax a letter stating they told me they could stop payment on one item and not the other erroneously they would reinstate my account. I went into my bank branch and they dont fax but ran the problem up to corporate. I received a call from XXXX corporate asking how they could make it right and offered to do a XXXX way call. XXXX wont call me back to do that. Every time I call I have to go over all this again. I want to add 2 things 1 ) if I did make a duplicate payment on Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX after making XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX why did they both hit my bank on am XX/XX/XXXX and not a day apart. XXXX explained that by saying the Monday XX/XX/XXXX payment must have been made after midnight. Thats impossible I never ever stay up after XXXX and bill pay during the day XXXX ) I tried to pay my XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX cards the exact amount and was given a pop up asking if I meant to make a duplicate payment. Does Lowes synchrony do this? Cant check because my account is closed. Ive never ever had a returned payment in this or any other payments ever!!!!!",
