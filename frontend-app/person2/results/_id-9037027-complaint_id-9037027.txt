I reopened the dispute mutiple times with USAA and the credit card department agreed that it should be refunded, but they told me each time that a different department handled disputes and each time that dispute was refused. \nI then filed a small claim against the movers and had my claims hearing on XX/XX/XXXX. The movers never showed and I was awarded the full amount claimed. The movers did not pay the judgement within the 30 days, so in XX/XX/XXXX, I again reopened the dispute with USAA and uploaded the court judgement that stated that the company owes me the money and getting denied yet again, I asked that the dispute be escalated and at the final escalation the only explanation they had for declining it was that the timeframe to file the dispute had passed. So they agreed that the dispute was valid, but they acted like I was making a new dispute rather than reopening the original dispute. \nI do not believe that is an acceptable excuse to refuse to refund the money as the court process takes time that I can not rush and then after the judgement I had to allow 30 days for the company to abide by the court judgement. I also was not making a new dispute, I was reopening a dispute that was filed well within the timeframe. The refusal to refund the money has no justification. The {$300.00} was refunded based on the exact same dispute, so the {$1200.00} must also be refunded since both disputes had the same justification.",
