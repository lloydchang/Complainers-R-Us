My drivers license and SSN were used online to open loans at various credit unions, which resulted in the opening of fraudulent accounts and hard inquiries on my credit history. These fraudulent activities occurred at various unions around XXXX of XXXX. When it came to my attention via XXXX credit monitoring, I created reports with XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX to dispute the accounts. The main credit unions involved, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX, CA ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX North Carolina ) have conducted investigations and have concluded that these accounts were fraudulent. Furthermore, these unions have notified the three major credit bureaus to remove the accounts and inquiries from my history. At time of writing, my XXXX and XXXX scores have returned to XXXX, and XXXX is still working on removing XXXX of the fraud accounts as a closed account. \n\nDue to the damage caused on my credit reports, Citi lowered my credit limits on two credit cards to {$4000.00}. Unfortunately, this at that time lowered credit limit and also increased my utilization, further lowering my credit.

In XX/XX/XXXX, I had resolved most of the fraudulent disputes but the bureaus where still processing my disputes. At that time, Citi advised me to request a credit line increase, whereas I was requesting my line be restored to what it initially was. They got an instant denial on my line increase, citing numerous delinquencies from the fraudulent accounts. They then told me to wait until XX/XX/XXXX to try again. \n\nI kept working with Citi and sending in reports from the fraud investigations, and on XX/XX/XXXX, an account XXXX submitted a Credit Bureau Dispute form. I never received any communication with results or follow up. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I followed up again. They again told me all I can do it submit a credit line increase. This did increase my line by {$4000.00} however that is still half of what my line was in XXXX. Furthermore, the only option they present me with at this time is to do an XXXX XXXX Line Increase which will pull a hard inquiry on my history and has no guarantee of a fair outcome. I should not have to place a hard inquiry on my history which I have worked very hard over the past two years to restore to an Excellent score. I have expressed my grievances with Citi and filed a complaint with them. As a customer they have reduced my credit line as a result of a crime committed against me and have made the recovery process incredibly frustrating when no wrongdoing was done on my part.",
