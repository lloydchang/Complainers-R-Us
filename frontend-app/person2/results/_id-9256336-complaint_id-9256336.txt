I called Comenity customer service, and they said that this is because of the residual interest on my account, ie. interest accrued in between the day of my statement on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX that does not show up on the account balance. They charged me {$2.00} in interest on XX/XX/XXXX, added another {$3.00} interest and {$2.00} late fee on the statement on XX/XX/XXXX, for a total of {$8.00}. I called Comenity to clear this up again on XX/XX/XXXX and they refused to remove the late fees, or acknowledge their error by misleading me to believe I had paid off my account and closed the account in full on XX/XX/XXXX. They said in order to pay off my account in full, I would need to pay {$10.00} including the residual interest that had accrued since my statement billing, as well as {$9.00} fee for paying through customer service. If I pay online, I can not pay more than {$8.00} since the statement balance does not update until the next billing cycle. Out of frustration, I hung up because these fees are just ridiculous in the first place. \nI called back on XX/XX/XXXX, and was informed that now, since I am 2 days past my due date, I will be charged {$8.00} late fee and whatever additional interest accrues on my account. \nThis company is a scam. I am paying these fees because I want the issue to be done with and never hear from Comenity again.
