The seller billed {$300.00} for the product but refrained from giving tracking after 3 separate requests, which is very unusual. They then stated \" delivered '' about 10 min before midnight when, before which, I could refund on XXXX at will. The product never arrived. Upon repeated demands they then provide tracking from XXXX that gives XXXX as the delivery location. The product weighs over XXXX. The package wt. on their tracking the seller provided was XXXX with overnight delivery ( which was not how it was sent ). I contacted XXXX and they confirmed the delivery address is NOT XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX CA XXXX ( my address to be delivered on XXXX ). The seller knew I caught them and so after being pressed, they sent me a message saying that the product had been stolen and they would refund it right away. They then turned around and did the exact opposite with Chase stating it was delivered and use this tracking as proof. The seller operates entirely out of XXXX. This appears sufficient for Chase to deny me getting my funds back and I can see a litany of other sellers not getting a product under this seller in the past also. \n\nWhy is this case being opened : Initially I notified XXXX by complaint and opened a case for fraud. I also notified Chase but said LET ME WORK THIS OUT WITH XXXX FIRS, I AM NOTIFYING YOU ONLY, AND WILL BE IN COMMUNICATION FOR FURTHER ACTION. Chase took action to contest the case right away, XXXX has a policy to back out if a card is involved and the XXXX case was closed. \n\nWorking with Chase directly : I have provided Chase with the email from the seller stating falsely that the item was stolen in the XXXX message log and that they would refund my money. I have provided the tracking slip to XXXX so that it can be verified my address on the XXXX delivery bill is not the address for the tracking. The Chased agent must call to verify this. I have provided the item spec showing the weight of the item is XXXX ( packed it will be up to XXXX ) and this can be compared to the tracking provide which is only XXXX XXXX. Even if the Chase agent did not call and calculate an overnight shipping rate, on the XXXX shipping calculator, it would be over {$900.00} to ship a {$300.00} product at that rate!! \n\nDespite opening multiple claims Chase claim number XXXX Chase claim number XXXX Chase keeps saying the same thing. They say there is no evidence of a billing error. I have never received any other answer than this and I do not see a connection with billing error and what I have described above. The agents in customer service also do not understand this statement and testify to me over the phone that it is obvious I should be refunded. The last agent said to go to the better business bureau or CFPB. So here I am. \n\nLastly, I really care about fraudulent people taking advantage of people. I can absorb {$300.00} easily but this is about stopping crime and it appears Chase has a loophole this scammer has identified so there will be repeated attempts at this. If Chase had a reason to give me they could not reimburse me for the scam, then they failed to communicate to me or to the agents who assisted me on what exactly the technical reason was. I am left with NO one knows why AND billing error are not related to what went wrong in this specific instance at any point. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. \nXXXX XXXX",
