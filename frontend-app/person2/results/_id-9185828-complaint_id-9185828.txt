I activated the offer on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX and received a confirmation of the activation from them. This offer was spend XXXX XXXXXXXX {$1900.00} and receive 10,000 bonus points, spend {$2000.00} or more and receive XXXX Thank You Points. After spending over {$2000.00} from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX I expected to receive these points. After reviewing my account since XX/XX/XXXX no points have been applied so I contacted them regarding this issue. They deny the offer was activated and indicated they don't see it in their system even though I have an email showing it was activated as they provided the confirmation. I have attempted to resolve this on 3 calls but they won't let me submit the proof email. They basically said too bad. I have activated and received several of these in the past with no issue. I was told they have issues with their Thank You Points system but there is nothing they can do. I wonder how many other card holders are being cheated out of points without realizing it.",
