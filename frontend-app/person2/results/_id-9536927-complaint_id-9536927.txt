After these payments were deducted in accordance with the verbally agreed settlement, they failed to close the account. At this time, the account has been forwarded to collections which has been harassing me for $ XXXX well above the amount that should have been written off in accordance with the settlement that has already been paid out on this account. This amounts to a pyramiding racket of racking up fees upon fees and has left me in complete distrust of this company for their shady credit card practices. The company states they can't do anything about it and that they don't have the settlement on file but they do show records of the payments made for the settlement I discussed on the phone that day.",
