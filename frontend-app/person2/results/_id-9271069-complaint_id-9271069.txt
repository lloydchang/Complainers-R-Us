  "complaint_what_happened": "Wells Fargo refuses to provide its customers with an itemized bill for their charges and are unable to terminate a customers credit card with them. I spent no less than 3 hours with representatives at Wells Fargo to get a claimed owed balance of {$100.00} explained ; I talked to no less than 6 or 7 representatives to get an itemization of that bill and had to repeat my predicament to each representative ( which was a sheer test of patience and tolerance ). A dishonest person used my credit card illegally and made 2 charges on it a couple of months ago ; Wells Fargo told me that they made a full recovery on both items. So, those expenses have no relevancy with the current {$100.00} charge. Of that {$100.00} balance, they can only show I approved 2 billings on that credit card ( 1 for {$21.00} and a 2nd for {$17.00} ). So the only charges I authorized ( and that they acknowledge ) total {$38.00} ; when asked for an itemization for the remaining {$65.00}, I was refused. All they wanted to talk about was the activities of the dishonest person they caught and got financial restitution from, not what I had authorized. Unable to come up with an explanation for the {$65.00} charge [ and identify the retailer ( s ) associated with that charge ], I was simply passed onto another representative to repeat my concerns all over again in a deliberate attempt to frustrate ( and they succeeded ). I do have a rewards balance of {$30.00} on their credit card and they refused to apply it to the {$65.00} balance or offer the benefit directly to me.\n\nUnable to appreciate Wells Fargo total disrespect and their claims that their bank is above the law and not required to justify anything, I then demanded that they ( Wells Fargo ) invalidate, void and terminate my credit card. They refused to honor that demand.\n\nThat dishonest person tried to rip-off Wells Fargo for {$300.00} and for {$50.00} ( on the same day ). How the {$100.00} balance is formulated makes no sense ( the one dishonest charge was for {$300.00}, so why the balance is not {$410.00} remains a mystery [ {$300.00} plus {$100.00} ] ). If Wells Fargo lied about the financial recoveries they made from the dishonest person ( or company ) ; well, that is reason for a second complaint. If Wells Fargo wants to punish a customer because their recovery team is understaffed, inept or slow to react, that is also reason for a second complaint. Of course, I am operating under the assurance that Wells Fargo offers theft protection ; if not, then that is reason to amend this complaint. All I ever wanted was to talk to someone who knows what their talking about or demanding and was refused.",
