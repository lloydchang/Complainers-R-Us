There is a {$720.00} charge on my statement from XX/XX/XXXX ( received while I was out of the country in XXXX ), that is fraudulent and that I will not be paying. I have scheduled the payment of this month 's payment of {$1200.00}, less the fraudulent charge of {$720.00}, resulting in payment of {$510.00} for XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nBelow is the log of information that I am maintaining on this dispute. \n\nI have created this log of activities related to a fraudulent charge on my Barclays credit card. \n\nSometime in early XXXX, I was contacted by Barclays indicating that there were suspicious activities on my card ending in XXXX. There were a few transactions, the largest of which was a {$700.00} plus charge from XXXX. I reported the invalid transactions, the card was terminated, and I received a new card. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I left the country for an extended trip to XXXX during cherry blossom season. I picked up my mail on XX/XX/XXXX, after I returned and found : My latest credit card statement, with the new number, again showing the XXXX charge. Also in the mail was a letter from the credit card company, Barclays bank, indicating that based upon documentation that they had received from the merchant, they had determined that the transaction was valid. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted the credit card company to ask them what documentation that they had received from the vendor to indicate that the charge was valid. The representative had no information and suggested that I contact the vendor again. They did agree to reopen the dispute. The new case number assigned is XXXX, and they can be contacted at XXXX XXXX. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX ( XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX ) and spoke to a servicing representative named XXXX. I indicated to her that I was calling because of a dispute that ended up on my credit card. I updated her that my first contact on the dispute came from the financial institution who flagged the card as having suspicious activity. One of the transactions was this one from XXXX. I provided the representative with my phone number, the transaction date of XX/XX/XXXX, the transaction amount of XXXX ( she indicated it was the purchase and curbside pick-up of a tankless hot water heater and valve at their store in XXXX, XXXX ) XXXX \n\nI am XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have a XXXX 's within XXXX miles of my house. I have never been to XXXX XXXX ( which is XXXX miles away ) and don't do major improvement projects myself. \n\nShe then indicated that this was no longer an open item for XXXX, but she could resubmit it to their Fraud Unit for review. She indicated that they had no phone number to provide me for the fraud unit, but that she could transfer me to and suggested that my next step is to re-contact my financial institution. \n\nLater, the same XX/XX/XXXX, I re-contacted Barclays bank. I discussed with the representative the current situation. I recapped my previous call with XXXX. I asked the representative what information that they had received from XXXX confirming a valid purchase. He indicated that he could find nothing that was uploaded into the regular customer service nor fraud storage locations supporting the claim that they had received information from XXXX. He indicated he would be forwarding for further review, and I should receive another letter within 30 days. I thanked him and indicated that there is no way I would make a payment in my next statement of the {$720.00} of the fraudulent XXXX charge. He said that would be noted. \n\nThat same day, within XXXX hour, Barclays responded that they have noted the dispute, that I will hear back from them in 45 days ( not the 30 days that was indicated in my telephone call ). \n\nThere appeared to be a \" tone '' change in their reply. First they indicated that the dispute was noted on my account, but it would not be subject to finance charges or the disputed amount. The seem to judge the dispute as being between me and XXXX 's. I have no relationship with XXXX 's related to a fraudulent transaction that I was not a part of. I see the dispute as between me and Barclays who accepted a merchant 's unverified transaction and posted it to my account. \n\nEither way, other than that early reply, I have received no other Barclays communication to date, other than my next statement, and sure enough, it has {$120.00} of interest charges for not paying the full amount of my prior bill. \n\nEqually stunning to me is that Barclays wants to put our relationship at risk over this transaction. In XXXX, I made $ XXXX of purchases with this account. In XXXX XXXX it was $ XXXX in purchases. \n\nPlease help get this matter closed.",
