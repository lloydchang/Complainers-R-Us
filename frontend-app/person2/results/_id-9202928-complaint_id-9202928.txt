  "complaint_what_happened": "In early XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Capital One to inquire about applying for a Venture XXXX credit card that was advertised as having a 0 % fee for approximately 15 months, and that 0 % applied to balance transfers. I spoke to a company rep who confirmed that I could do a balance transfer up until XX/XX/XXXX. I explained to her that was the whole reason I was willing to apply. I told her I would do the transfer immediately, even though the other balance was not coming due until XX/XX/XXXX, but she said I could wait until XX/XX/XXXX because the 0 % on balance transfers would be available until XX/XX/XXXX. Based on this, I applied for and was approved for {$20000.00} credit. In the application I specifically stated that I was applying in order to transfer the balance of the XXXX  XXXX XXXX credit card to this new card. I was told that the balance transfer benefit could not be activated until 11 days after account opening. So, I was in no rush. In early XXXX I contacted the company to find out by when I should initiate the balance transfer process in order to make sure the other XXXX  XXXX XXXX credit card balance was paid off in time ( by XX/XX/XXXX ). The rep looked and said that she could no longer see the balance transfer offer on my account. She then looked at the details of my account and confirmed that the terms stated that I would have a 0 % rate on balance transfers that were completed by XX/XX/XXXX. Accordingly, she said she would escalate this matter to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and she assured me it shouldn't be a problem getting it approved. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, the Supervisor of the Capital One XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX called me and said the balance transfer offer was no longer available on my account, and she could not explain why it was no longer there! When I said I wanted to escalate this matter to her XXXX, she said her XXXX  do not accept calls from customers, and that she was the only one who could resolve it, but she had no authority or power to resolve this issue despite acknowledging how frustrating this must be for me. This was a bait and switch! A prime example of an unfair business practice. I relied on the 0 % balance transfer in applying for the Venture XXXX credit card despite knowing it would be a \" ding '' on my credit history. The terms that were advertised and that were confirmed by several company representative were inexplicably reversed and the company can not even explain why. Capital One, if they value their reputation in the marketplace, should honor the terms I relied upon in opening an account with them. Respectfully ( but angrily ) submitted, XXXX XXXX XXXX",
