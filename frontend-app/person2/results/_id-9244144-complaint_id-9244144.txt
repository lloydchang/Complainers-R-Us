  "complaint_what_happened": "I filed a complaint with the CFPB and it is currently active. I have communicated with CHASE on numerous occassions as to why my credit limit of {$5800.00} had not been restored. They cited that two payments of over {$5000.00} had tried to clear my account and they had to wait to get that settled first. This occured when I attempted to pay my credit card off and the fraudeluent payment I contacted CFPB about overlapped. My full payment could not be applied because the fraudulent payment removed from my account was in process of being refunded. Eventually the pay off was applied and a balance of XXXX remained. I was told my credit limit of XXXX would be reinstated on XX/XX/XXXX. It was not and I called again being told it would be the first week of XXXX ( I do mnot recall the exact date but I think it was XX/XX/XXXX ). I checked and it was reinstated to the {$5800.00} and the balance of course was the XXXX. I then allowed several charges to go through and set a limit of no more than {$2000.00} ever being charged on this card again. I have these conversations recorded and I am sure chase does too. Please request the conversations so that you will see I asked multiple times about my {$5800.00} credit limit.\n\nTo my horror I received a letter yesterday that my credit limit was reduced to {$1800.00}! I was mortified as I have been in constant communication with Chase and was never told my limit was up fpr reduction but was ensured the complete opposite that my full credit line was being reinstated! They reduced it by {$4000.00} causing yet another hit on my credit score! I received an alert today that my credit score dropped by XXXX points! This is clearly retaliation for contacting CFPB. All the reasons stated are fale my credit score is not XXXX but was XXXX I do not have any high balances I have no charge offs slow pays or late pays! I am hypertensive and I was unable to function at work due to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. My credit is vital in provising care for my mother with XXXX. She has to have a care giver and ona XXXX  salary credit is a must. My dad recently passed and I shared with Chase as a long time customer the way I have been treated is deplorable. I have been a customer for about XXXX years and to be treated this way in the midst of personal crisis is beyond debilitating. Had I been informed my credit line was going to be decreased to {$1800.00} there is no way I would have used this card. Id have paid the XXXX and left the card unused I have several other cards i could have used. One has a {$9800.00} credit limit and has less than {$1000.00} on it and the other is {$4800.00} with a XXXX balance. This is sabatoge and retatliation and I am going to make sure this is made known to all. Please pull the recordings where I was told the balance would be reinstated to {$5800.00} once my payment of over {$5000.00} cleared. I have good credit and I paid the card almost off.This is criminal. Please provide the CEO of Chases number please. I asked for a number for the complainr department or an emai land was told I had to write a letter????",
