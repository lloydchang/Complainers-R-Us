  "complaint_what_happened": "On XX/XX/XXXX - the fraud department at Wells Fargo contacted me. I was told somebody in Texas was using my credit card and attempting to transfer a cash advance from my unused VISA card for an amount over {$22000.00} into my checking. I was told the transfer was not allowed. I informed wells fargo on the phone and via text that the transfer was not authorized and to not let it go through. \nXX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and as well on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX -- I made several calls to Wells Fargo to work on resetting my internet access as it became evident to them that somebody hacked into my internet banking and they shut it down. \nI was under the impression the charges would not go thru and all activity was stopped during the fraud investigation. When I finally gained entry to my account -- I saw the CHARGES went through. I called again. And was told it takes 10 days to resolve the fraud. When I asked why the charges went through and why the fraud prevention unit who contacted me didn't prevent is as they were supposed to - the agent couldn't answer that question -- but assured me it would be resolved. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I was notified that my credit score dropped form XXXX to XXXX due to an over the limit charge on my wells fargo card ( because the fraud charge was allowed to go thru ). In addition, this took up a substantial portion of available credit, thus the XXXX point drop in my credit score. I contacted Wells Fargo and was told that nobody reached out to me on XX/XX/XXXX - but that I contacted them on XX/XX/XXXX. This is inaccurate as I even recieved a text from the fraud department on XX/XX/XXXX ... .And I have phone records that show my conversation with Wells on XX/XX/XXXX ( it is a wells fargo number that called me- I made sure of that during my conversation with that first agent ). When I finally found someone who could confirm they saw the contacts. Wells Fargo rep apologized that anything went through - there was still no resolution. -- -- The bad actor used my credit card to fill my checking account with money from my VISA card so he could get a cash advance. GOOD NEWS. Wells stopped that. BAD NEWS -- they were supposed to stop it on XX/XX/XXXX and never let it happen. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and my credit score is effected and there is a lump sum of money sitting in that checking account and a credit card that is over the limit -- - nothing has been done to resolve the charges and update the error of reporting that credit line to my credit report ( again, that cash is sitting in the checking account ). How difficult is it to move the money back? Additionally, the card has been shut down and a new card has been issued. But the BANK - WELLS FARGO - moved the fraudulent balance to the new card. ( Again that money is sitting in the checking account on a transaction that I did not create ). \n\nThe cards and the accounts have remained mostly dormant for over a year, as I had a similar issue with Wells Fargo and moved almost every XXXX to XXXX XXXX. I had left a few dollars in the XXXX account to ensure no unitentional drafts came through after moving everything. Sadly, Wells Fargo has not figured out that Fraud Prevention -- means prevention. I'm still dumbfounded that they called me on XX/XX/XXXX and let the charges go through --. I just want the accounts straightened out and the credit bureau entry to be removed as reported in error. I will then close the accounts and never use Wells Fargo again. Your help for a speedy resolution is requested.",
