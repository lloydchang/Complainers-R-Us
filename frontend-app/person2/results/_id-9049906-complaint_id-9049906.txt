  "complaint_what_happened": "On XX/XX/XXXX, I became aware that approximately {$6300.00} was charged to my credit card account between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX when I went online to make a payment on my Citi Flex Loan as I had not used the credit card in several months. I immediately contacted Citibank. I confirmed that none of these charges were authorized by me. I also confirmed I was always in possession of my card and had not authorized anyone else to use it. I was told they would open an investigation. Even after canceling my card, I noticed charges from XXXX. I called Citibank again and was told that I had to call XXXX to remove the card from their app, which I did. Those charges have since been credited. \nI received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating that the investigation and dispute were closed. I called back to reopen the dispute. I then received an email from Citibank dated XX/XX/XXXX that they had heard back from a merchant asking me to confirm whether or not a transaction was authorized. It was a food and beverage charge in the amount of {$25.00} XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I responded via email on XXXX XXXX. The receipt provided shows that it was charged to room XXXX with arrival date of XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. The signature is clearly not mine. This charge was credited. I was also credited {$85.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, which I am guessing is the charge for that XXXX night. Then, he must have checked in again on XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX and there is a charge of {$390.00} which was not credited. On this same email, I included an Incident from the XXXX Police Department regarding a deceased person found at the XXXX XXXX XXXX. The case was still being investigated so they couldnt provide any further information at that time. I didnt hear anything further, so I sent an email to the attention of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX. I included the above information/attachments as well as the incident number ( XXXX ) for the police report I filed with the XXXX XXXXXXXX Police Department . I received a phone call on XX/XX/XXXX from the XXXX office at Citibank ( phone number ( XXXX ). They were going to send the dispute back to the investigative team. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call from the same number stating that there wasnt anything further they could do for me. I asked to speak to the investigative team and was told that was not possible. To date, they have credited {$1400.00} but there are still outstanding charges of {$4800.00} plus interest and fees",
