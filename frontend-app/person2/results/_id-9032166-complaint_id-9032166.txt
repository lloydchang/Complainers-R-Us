This new/replacement credit card never arrived in my mailbox. On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed multiple transactions on my card that happened between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately called the bank and informed that credit card has fraudulent transactions of purchases, online payments and cash withdrawals. None of these transactions are done by me. Bank agent did acknowledge that card is compromised and logged the case for further investigation. We were told that we will hear back in XXXX  days. On XX/XX/XXXX, Bank sent a letter saying that transactions are valid and closed the case. \nWe called the fraud claim department and got the case reopened and provided bank with Police case number that we got registered. Also, we did inform bank that lately there had been mail theft issue in and around the community. After the XXXX round of investigation, bank again sent a letter to us informing that transactions are valid, and asked us to pay {$14000.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, again called the bank XXXX department and requested to reopen the case. While going over the case with us, the agent confirmed that all transactions are done by the card that we never got. It is a clear case of theft and forgery. Bank asked us to provide additional information as evidence such as Mobile/Telephone bill showing our location ( this we provided along with other evidence too. All of this is attached here as well. ) XXXX XXXX concern is that a ) WHO/how the replacement card got stolen b ) How was the card activated? c ) WHY bank did not have any alert mechanism activated and allowed multiple huge transactions in XXXX weeks ( my purchase pattern had been only few XXXX dollars each month for last many years since I had the card ). d ) When we never got the card, why bank is making us liable to pay. Bank can easily verify the card that was used for transactions with its expiration date and other details. It can also identify the location, mechanism and other details that was used to activate the card. The transaction on card is done across the country where as I have been at my home throughout the duration when theft happened. ( I have attached mobile bills as evidence. I have attached multiple other evidence as well ) BANK is NOT doing its due diligence to identify theft and ASKING me to pay this huge amount for no fault of mine. I have been a customer with Wells Fargo bank for last XXXX years and have been using its credit card for last multiple years.",
