I called Bank of America and requested that the monies be refunded to me immediately. After numerous calls to the credit card company, I was advised that a check was mailed to me at my verified address on XX/XX/2024 however I never received the check. I was advised that I needed to wait 10 business days to request that the check be re-issued ; which I did on XX/XX/2024. I still have not received the check, so I contacted Bank of America again XX/XX/2024 and was advised that my request to reissue the check was still being processed and they are still within, their legal timeline. I have been waiting over two months to receive the money that was sent to Bank of America after my account was closed and XXXX and his supervisor XXXX today were of no assistance in assuring that this money gets refunded. I do not feel it is appropriate for the credit card company to withhold my money for two months",
