  "complaint_what_happened": "Here is my story, on XX/XX/XXXX I discovered I was delinquent on my XXXX account. I logged into my account online paid the past due amount of {$170.00} and issued a dispute since I dont recall using this card for anything. On XX/XX/XXXX, I paid the minimum due, on XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX Synchrony to dispute a charge that I did not recognize, that was made on XX/XX/XXXX for {$59.00}. The last time I used my XXXX Synchrony bank XXXX was in XX/XX/XXXX and it was paid in full on the XXXX of the same month. From then I had no reason to think there were any charges on this account since paid off. All purchases ( if any ) going forward were using XXXX XXXX instead. So on XX/XX/XXXX on the phone discussing this account with XXXX Synchrony bank, I started my dispute process of a charge that was found not to be made by me on XX/XX/XXXX. Once I disputed the charge, I was told they would file the dispute and let me know the results and they mentioned that they would re-issue me a new account number and card. 60 days later, I see the account has not been resolved. I am being charged again for a late fee on the account and I paid {$30.00} to cover that late fee. This alerted me to call to check on the status of the dispute. When you add it all this up. {$59.00} charge plus late fees and interest on the account since has ballooned to {$170.00} of which I paid now another {$30.00} of which I paid to try to keep my good credit standing with Synchrony Bank. \nIt wasnt until XX/XX/XXXX that I called back again to inquire about the status, and to let them know that I have not received the new card. After several calls and speaking with customer service, I was advised that the account had been closed before my call on XX/XX/XXXX for lack of payment yet no one mentioned that to me on XXXX while requesting the dispute for the charge that started all this. The closure of my XXXX account caused Synchrony to close my Lowes XXXX XXXX account of which I had just received a newly printed design card somewhere around the middle of XXXX only now to find out that this delinquent account was the reason for the closure of my Lowes account. I have several other Synchrony bank Cards and none of them were closed only the Lowes  of which I still have a balance and have never missed a payment of any of them. \nAfter speaking with Customer Service, I asked to speak with the Fraud department and reached XXXX after several more attempts to explain the situation to him he wanted to transfer me back to Customer Service until I asked to speak with someone US-based. I was connected to XXXX ; he was the best source of information in letting me know that the dispute was in the investigation department but they have no obligation to update the account with the call attempts for status checks. I was informed that it should take 60 days to complete the investigation and I should wait till 60 days to get an answer on how they would move forward and that if they file in my favor all issues that stem from the fraudulent charge would be corrected including the closure of my XXXX  account. \nNow, XX/XX/XXXX. 6 months after the initial dispute request. I am being told that the initial dispute request did not include the actual date of the charge for investigation and that it would take another 30 days to investigate further. But what I asked XXXX, via phone who seems very helpful in fraud and investigations, I am not sure. She was going to request the XXXX account be reopened and find out who can reopen the Lowes account because it is possible that the Lowes account was closed due to my XXXX account closure of XXXX XXXX. \nI am requesting that CFPB contact Synchrony on my behalf and see about reopening my account with Lowes XXXX XXXX. I have had those accounts for years with no issues or late payments and with other Synchrony accounts. And being a homeowner, my Lowes account is very important to me. My record is spotless with Lowes and I wish to retain it.",
