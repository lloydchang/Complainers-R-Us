It is possible that some statements did not reach me during this tumultuous period. \n\nGiven the extenuating circumstances surrounding my medical emergency and financial challenges, I urge your immediate attention to rectify these inaccuracies. These late payments are unjustified and are negatively impacting my credit profile, potentially affecting my financial opportunities. \n\nI kindly request the following actions to be taken swiftly : Removal of the late payment entries for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX from my credit report. \nXXXX and adjustment of my payment history to accurately reflect my payments during the mentioned periods. \nConfirmation that all late payment remarks associated with my account are expunged from my credit history. \nI emphasize that these inaccuracies not only undermine the agreed-upon assurances but also constitute violations under relevant consumer protection laws, including provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).
