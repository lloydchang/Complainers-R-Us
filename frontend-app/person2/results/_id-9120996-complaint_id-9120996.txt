Since I was never told what this additional transaction was for, I dont know how I could have received any benefit. I paid my rental in full and closed the transaction at the time of return with XXXX, so the only person receiving any benefit from an additional fraudulent {$250.00} charge would be XXXX, not me. I have escalated this with Chase, but they have not shared any additional rationale about what benefit I received and why I should pay this {$250.00} fraudulent charge. They continue to side with a mega car rental company ( AVIS ), and are not concerned with their individual customer. I want them to resolve this on my behalf and remove this fraud charge from my account based on the shared and transparent facts from both parties in this situation.",
