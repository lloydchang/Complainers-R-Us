Your attached document stated that there were no fraud activities on my closed credit card. I have complained just I could not use the reward certificates and complained it. I did not care whether there were fraud activities or not, since I paid off everything. I just missed the opportunity to enjoy using rewards. Anyway, your company interest rate is high ; therefore, it might be better to close. I received the bill and paid off the amount of {$470.00} today through my banking account. There is one reward certificate ending numbers are XXXX, even though I am not sure whether I can use it or not. I strongly believe it is not usable since I could not use several in the past. I always wonder why there are so many branches relating all matters I am working on, which cause the confusion on the customers side. \nSincerely,",
