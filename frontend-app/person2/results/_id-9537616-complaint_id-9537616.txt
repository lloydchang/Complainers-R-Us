I think I'm getting ahead of myself so let me start from the beginning : The original fraudulent charges were made between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. My XXXX account was hacked and a fake user was added as an administrator for my XXXX XXXX account. I run a XXXX XXXX XXXX and used XXXX ads to market to families in my area, limiting ads to {$15.00} or {$20.00} per day. Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX there were bathing suit ads running with spend limits of {$500.00}, {$3000.00} and $ XXXX ( see attached screenshots ). Overall there were just under {$5000.00} in fraudulent charges for a fake bathing suit company in XXXX. \n\nI called Wells Fargo to open a case and they assured me everything would be reversed and that I'd get a new card. They said it could take up to 10 business days to remove all the fraudulent charges. I don't know if this is relevant, but they also never actually sent out the new card ; when I called to ask the status of the card, the representative said, \" huh this is weird, it says it was sent but it never actually sent. '' Again, I don't know if that's relevant but it makes me wonder what's going on at that company. \n\nAnyway, the charges were reversed and my new card balance transferred and eventually I got the card so I figured everything was right again. Then yesterday some weird things started happening : my credit limit is {$18000.00} and showed a current balance of $ XXXX and change. I was declined trying to make a {$900.00} purchase and called to find out why. The rep said they've been having similar issues since Sunday and to just wait a couple days and it should sort itself out. I said okay and figured I could make the purchase the next day ( today ). \n\nWhen I went to check my account this morning, my account balance was suddenly over {$20000.00}!!!!!!!!!!!! I frantically went to the transactions to see if I was hacked again, only to find 18 \" balance transfers '' in the same amounts as the fraudulent transactions from XXXX. I called the bank again, thinking obviously there's some mistake. They do not provide any further information, only saying that I will receive a letter in the mail?! I'm concerned that they are reversing the credit for the fraudulent charges, and the representative would only say that they've opened a new case ( I'm uncertain why they are not continuing the old case ), and that it could take up to 45 days to be resolved. That new case number is XXXX This is not acceptable and it would be incredibly baffling to discover that they find in favor of the fraudulent charges. It is so obviously fraud that I can not believe they even allowed the charges in the first place! 18 charges in three days totaling almost {$5000.00} when I usually only spend $ XXXX?! \n\nThank you for your assistance.",
