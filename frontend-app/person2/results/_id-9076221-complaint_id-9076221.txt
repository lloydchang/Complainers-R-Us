I bought a set of XXXX XXXX and I returned it a couple days later to the exact same store. The store said the issued credit will come onto my card but till this day it has not yet been received. I called AMEX and XXXX XXXX XXXX trying to get this resolved but neither parties could not help me. Please, it's been a while since these issues have happened, but this is causing me a headache and my only hope is to contact the CFPB.",
