A hard inquiry was applied to my credit report. \n\nI used the card once on XX/XX/XXXX for {$69.00}. I attempted a purchase of {$39.00} for an overseas course company and the transaction was blocked on XX/XX/XXXX. I called to verify it was me making the purchase. The rep asked 3 times if I was out of the country. I stated no I was in the US making a purchase with an overseas merchant. They stated the card was unblocked and to make the purchase again. Card was declined again. Called again and a rep asked again if I was in the actual country I was purchasing from. I stated again no I am in the US purchasing from an overseas merchant. XXXX stated the card was unblocked and to wait 5 to 10 minutes before trying to purchase again. Waited an hour or so, tried again and the purchase failed. Called Destiny MasterCard again on XX/XX/XXXX and a rep asked if I was in the country. I stated yes and they place me on a hold for XXXX minutes and then disconnected the call. \n\nI paid a {$170.00} in full for the annual fee and was allowed to make XXXX charge on the account. After that, it was promptly blocked, and the reps have not been able to actually resolve the issue. This company also asked for my driver 's license to place my card into my XXXX XXXX. I did so, was successfully verified only to be told to wait until my card arrived. This company now has my personal information and did not comply with adding my card to my wallet as stated. I feel this is data mining and a bait and switch to get customer data and information. \n\nAlso, this can open customers to possible discrimination as the customer 's driver 's license data can be used allegedly by Concora Credit Inc, Destiny MasterCard, and their representatives and staff to block purchases, reduce limits, etc. based off the customers driver 's license data which includes a photo image, race, age, weight, geographic location, etc.",
