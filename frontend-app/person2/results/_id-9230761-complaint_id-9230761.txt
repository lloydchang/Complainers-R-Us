  "complaint_what_happened": "On XX/XX/XXXX, while on the phone with customer service rep XXXX. from Citibank N.A., I was offered the ability to be included into a short term rewards program. After listening to the disclosures I agreed to be included. The program is set to last for 6 months, from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX where I am to receive 3 % back on 'ALL PURCHASES '. After receiving several monthly statements since the rewards program inception, I soon noticed the 3 % rewards did not coincide with my spending. Therefore, on XX/XX/XXXX I called Citibank N.A. to inquire as to the reasons for the discrepancy. On that call, similar to the previous call, I was told by the rep that I would receive 3 % back on 'ALL PURCHASES '. I pushed her on the details and asked if that meant bill payments for utility, cell phone, etc and she countered with 'ALL PURCHASES ( where the card is present ) '. This means NOT ALL PURCHASES! These Citibank reps are totally misrepresenting the terms of this rewards program and are deceiving consumers like myself. As a result of being included into this rewards program, I have diverted my spending on a consumer credit card that pays 1.5 % back on 'ALL PURCHASES ' just to start using my Citibank card to receive 3 % back on NOT ALL PURCHASES. This has forced me to forgo hundreds of dollars in rewards for such purchases as hotel/car rentals as well as all XXXX purchases made XXXX XXXX. I respectfully request the phone calls from both dates listed above ( XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) be pulled to confirm the merits of this complaint.",
