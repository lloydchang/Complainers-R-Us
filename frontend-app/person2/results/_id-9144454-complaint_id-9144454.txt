Mine was expiring XX/XX/XXXX. It has said \" expires XX/XX/XXXX '' I went in today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and it said {$0.00} travel credit. So, I called the Capital One XXXX ( not credit card ). They told me that they see my travel credits as expiring on XX/XX/XXXX & there was nothing they could do. I was connected to the credit card side of things, who said that my {$300.00} travel credit EXPIRED already on XX/XX/XXXX. I said it's still XX/XX/XXXX. They said there was nothing they could do, the date could not be extended, etc. I was not offered any other compensation ( miles, bonus, etc ). I decided to close my account, and decided to transfer my account miles ( XXXX ) to an airline partner before closing my account. In trying to do that, I was prompted to\n\ndo MFA ( multi factor authentication ) and just continuously got looped to log out. There was a number to call, which had me waiting on hold and I had to get back to work, so I logged off. I eventually cashed in the miles/points for cash, which I did NOT want to do since it's an ineffective use of them, but I wanted to close out the account as soon as possible. I did call to close the account and reiterated the situation, asking to have my two issues escalated. Again, I was not offered an alternative and was reminded of the travel credit that comes with the card, which I could not use. Long story short - could not use the {$300.00} credit THROUGH the date it said. The travel department of Capital One had a different expiry date than listed.\nAs an aside, I did ask the Capital One XXXX people why LAST year 's ( XXXX ) credit also shows an expiry date of XX/XX/XXXX, but they couldn't tell me.
