  "complaint_what_happened": "Two Dispute issues : 1. I ordered a book from a book retailer called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ). The XXXX XXXX *cancelled* the book and ALL ORDERS from book retailers were ALSO cancelled. I provided a statement from XXXX XXXX XXXX  that was available to the public stating that all orders were cancelled. I also provided an e-mail from a 2nd book retailer supporting my point that when the PUBLISHER cancels all orders the RETAILERS *must* follow suit ( they cancelled a separate order I put in ). However, ONE YEAR LATER, the publisher RE-SOLICITED the same book. Every other retailer had to take and enter NEW orders for this solicitation. But THIS one book retailer took it upon themselves to use my previously-but-now-cancelled charge approval and went ahead and applied to a NEW charge on the NEW solicitation of the book. The bookseller charged me and sent the book... even tho \" the charge was meant to ONLY be applied to a now-cancelled product. I tried to return it ; the retailer wouldn't accept it ( the book was unopened, as was the box it came in ). Discover Card sided w/the book seller, even though I sent demonstrable proof that my approval can not and should not have been applied to a wholly new order, no matter that it was for the same item at the same price. Simply put, I gave NO approval for this charge, only for the PREVIOUSLY ( cancelled ) charge. \n********* XXXX. My web hosting company, a group called XXXX, was hosting my websites for several years. Recently, I cancelled all of the hosting. There was a {$21.00} charge put on my Discover card in advance of the renewal ( a standard practice at web hosts so that users like me don't have an interruption in service ). I contacted XXXX XXXX customer service and asked them to reverse the \" in advance '' charge b/c I wasn't certain I'd be renewing my services with them. They said \" No problem '' and told me the charge was reversed. When I check my card activity, I see that XXXX XXXX only credited me {$11.00}. I disputed the remaining {$10.00} with Discover and also contacted XXXX XXXX about this. XXXX XXXX told me it was surcharge for the last-minute change of mind, but I explained that their own cancel rules indicate I cancelled early enough to not be taxed w/the {$10.00} charge. They agreed to look into it further and, a few weeks later, refunded me the {$10.00}. SEVERAL weeks after that, Discover Card went ahead and randomly ADDED THE FULL {$21.00} back to my balance! There's NO reason for that -- Blue Host refunded me. But, in spite of the evidence again, Discover card sided w/the retailer, in spite of their being NO charge to side with them on. \n********* This CLEARLY indicates a pattern of behavior at Discover Card where Discover is purposefully siding with retailers to ensure they get to keep whatever percentage of these charges that they make THEIR money from. They stealing from consumers, and I will be you they have been doing this FOR YEARS and that there are XXXX of Discover Card consumers whose Disputes were ILLEGALLY found in favor of the store and NOT the consumer JUST SO Discover can be sure to keep that small percentage of money which, of course, piles up to hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars a year! \nXXXX  I would like to formally request that the CFPB not just research MY disputes but investigate the Discover Card company for FRAUD. I am 100 % certain you will find XXXX of cases of this fraud on the part of Discover Card over the last WHO KNOWS how many years. \nXXXX  Another, separate, example of Discover Card fraud : I put my credit card on \" frozen '' status after a number of the errors so that I didn't use it any longer, but I left it as frozen ( as opposed to cancelling it ) just in case there was an autopayment that I missed. Well, while at the website eBay, I apparently accidentally chose the Discover card for 2 recent payments. Now, when the card is \" Frozen '' ONLY autopayments ( like phone bill or gas, etc. ) are supposed to post ; everything else is supposed to be rejected, so this is another fraud being perpetrated by them. \nXXXX Now, I did make those purchases and accidentally choosing the Discover card is MY fault, but the fact that my card was \" XXXX '' and the charges went through? That's a HUGE red flag ... and supports my point that Discover does NOT want to protects its customers but rather wants to wring as much money as possible out of its credit card users. Once more, I implore your organization to do a full, deep, and VERY detailed investigation. There is no doubt something rotten here! \nXXXX  Thank you.",
