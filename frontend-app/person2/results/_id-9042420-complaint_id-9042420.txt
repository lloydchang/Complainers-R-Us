I was enrolled in 48 months promotional interest free plan. Before the promotion end I made all my payments on time. My promotional plan was ending on XXXX XXXX and I made all my payment by XXXX XXXX. \nOn XXXX XXXX I made one payment of {$200.00} online and tried making another payment of leftover balance of XXXX but the system was not accepting. I called the XXXX credit card and told them I am trying to make a payment online but system is not taking so I was told you can only make one payment a day online. Then I told the representative that I want to make a payment which I did over the phone with the representative. On XX/XX/XXXX I checked my bank account and saw that one payment of {$200.00} was withdraw but the other payment I did over the phone with the representative is not showing up. I called the XXXX XXXX  credit card customer service and inquired about the situation and was told that their representative did not enter the account number right which is why the payment is being returned. I told them I want to make a payment again but they told me the system is not letting them accept the payment. I asked them if I can go to any of their store and make a payment and was told I can try that. I called the XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX store and inquired them about accepting payments in store. I was told they do not accept in store. Finally on XXXX XXXX the balance reflected back into my account with the return fee of {$23.00}. I did my payment right away of XXXX and called them to reimburse me of {$23.00} of return fee as they promised they will credit that and all the interest if they happen to charge me which they did. I called them today again but did not really got any help. I am in so much stress that it cant take good care of my family. I have XXXX kids. They are causing me a lot of stress even though I did all my payments on time. \nMy phone number is XXXX Please call me and do reply",
