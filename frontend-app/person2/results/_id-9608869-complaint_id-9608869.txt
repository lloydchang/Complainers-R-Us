Because of the potential for this change to have a substantially negative impact on my access to credit I am not willing to wait for Bank of America to respond. \n\nI received a letter dated XX/XX/year>, that lists three reasons that Bank of America elected to decrease my credit limit : Current or past delinquency on one or more of your accounts with us and/or our affiliates Recent trend in balance on one or more of your accounts, with us and our affiliates, compared to past balance Strength of payment on one or more of your accounts with us and/or our affiliates. \n\nAs the letter advised, I immediately reviewed my credit report from XXXX XXXX. Based on the report as of XX/XX/year>, no evidence supports any reasons for reducing my credit limit. There is no indication of any late payments on the credit report, no irregular or rapid increase or decrease in my balance owed, and my payments have been consistent and automatic for many years. When my promotional rate on a portion of my balance recently expired, I ensured that my automated payments increased to cover the new minimums. \n\nThe only recent change that occurred in my relationship with Bank of America or their affiliates was the expiration of my promotional balance transfer rate on a portion of my balance. The expiry is likely the real reason my credit limit decreased. There is no evidence on my credit report supporting the reasons given. As mentioned above, I needed to adjust my payments, and I did so before the XX/XX/XXXX due date, which was more than XXXX days after the date of the XX/XX/XXXX letter informing me of the decision to lower my credit limit. \n\nBecause the decision to lower my credit limit will harm my ability to obtain credit and be used as a basis to either increase my interest rate or further decrease my credit limit. The justifications listed in the XX/XX/XXXX letter do not stand up to even the most cursory inspection of my credit report from XXXX XXXX or any of the other XXXX credit reporting agencies. \n\nThis decision to reduce my credit limit is arbitrary and an attempt to manipulate my financial reputation. At worst, it is a cynical attempt to undo the promotional balance transfer rates Bank of America has previously offered. \n\nI have attached my most current credit reports and the letter I sent to Bank of America.",
