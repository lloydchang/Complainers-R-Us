But I refused to pay the interest as it is not my fault I didnt receive the notice that I owed money. They said they cant waive the Interest. Which I find outrageous. They collect fees every time I use this credit card and have made plenty of money from me.

Please make them waive the interest and stop charging for paper statements. This is for synchrony bank XXXX reward card.",
