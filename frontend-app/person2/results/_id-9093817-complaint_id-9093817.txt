This issue occurs consistently with all foreign refunds, regardless of the date ( including same-day transactions ) or the country involved. The consistent difference between the original charge and the refunded amount suggests a fixed fee, not a foreign currency exchange fluctuation. According to Alliant Credit Union 's policy, they do not charge a fee for foreign currency exchange on refunds. \n\nSpecific Example : Transaction Date : XX/XX/year>2024 ( Settlement Date : XX/XX/year>2024 ) Merchant : XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Location : XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX ) Original Charge : {$6.00} Refund Received : {$6.00} Suspected Cause : Alliant Credit Union may be retaining a fixed fee on refunded foreign transactions, which is not disclosed in their policy. Alliant said the merchants are not returning the full funds. I contacted all merchants involved, and the merchants confirmed issuing full refunds for the original purchase amounts.",
