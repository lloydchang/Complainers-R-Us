I sent a complaint letter to Synchrony Bank, dated XX/XX/year>, and received a response from the bank, dated XX/XX/year> which does not address the reason for my complaint, which has to do with the banks photo identification recognition software, not the identification questions. \n\nI have attached all related correspondence with this complaint. \n\nThe reason for my request is that despite my sound credit history, the denial of my application seems to rest solely on the inability of the banks recognition software to validate my image with that of my government-issued Utah Drivers License. When the software could not validate my image with my drivers license, I offered to have the banks customer service agent use my US passport but was not given the chance to do so. This all occurred on XX/XX/year>, after I had been preapproved. \n\nAfter attempting four times on the phone that day ( with two different agents ) to get the banks process to validate my identity, I was told that there was nothing else I could do. I asked the second agent with whom I worked if I could go to the Synchrony Bank location at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. in XXXX, Utah to seek assistance. That agent said that I was welcome to do so. \n\nWhen I made the XXXX XXXX to the XXXX location, I discovered that there was only a security guard there who told me that there was no in-person staff for Synchrony Bank at that location and that it was merely a mailing address. He did, however, give me online information about contacting Synchrony Bank. I subsequently received my credit denial letter from the bank a few days after driving down to XXXX. \n\nI found this process extremely frustrating and perplexing, given that I used similar software to validate my identity with the Internal Revenue Service a few days before I worked with Synchrony Bank agents, and the IRS had no problems reconciling my ID with my software-captured image. The lighting and location of the process were the same so the problem with the banks software was not due to operator error on my part. \n\nAs a relatively new homeowner, I prefer shopping at Lowes for my home improvement needs. This credit denial limits my ability to do business with LOWEs. In their correspondence of XX/XX/XXXX, the bank assures me that my credit history will not be affected by this denial, however, the fact that the banks software can not reconcile my image with their software is not my problem as a potential applicant. I am being negatively impacted because of their process. \n\nI want to find a solution to this problem because the denial seemingly has nothing to do with my credit history or my ability to be approved because of my credit history. The banks reply of XX/XX/XXXX to my complaint does not address the photo software problem and instead refers to security questions. This does not comport with my experience with the banks agent on XX/XX/XXXX. The bank offers no option for remediating this challenge in person where I could show someone my ID and any other verification to show I am who I say I am. \n\nThe security guard at the XXXX location mentioned that he often has individuals showing up asking for in-person assistance on issues such as mine. \n\nThank you for your assistance with this matter.",
