  "complaint_what_happened": "I had made XXXX purchases at an auction and the items purchased were not worth what their appraisals stated. I disputed these transactions through my credit card ( Chase Freedom ), but Chase refused to help me stating that the charges were not disputable because : 1 ) i willingly gave the auction my credit card, 2 ) the charges were not done by someone else. So, I located the auction house and threatened litigation, among other things, and a rep flew to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and refunded my money ( {$8300.00} ) WITHOUT any help from Chase. I called Chase on on XX/XX/XXXX to confirm the refund was credited, and Chase confirmed that it was. Chase told me I had to wait for the credit to post and then it would take XXXX days to receive a refund check ( since I had already paid off the original charge of {$8300.00} ). I called Chase on XX/XX/XXXX and confirmed the refund/credit had posted, and I requested a refund check. NEVER was I told that if there were any charges after XX/XX/XXXX, that Chase could arbitrarily decide to subtract ALL of those charges and refund me the difference, but that's exactly what Chase did. I had made some additional charges on the card AFTER XX/XX/XXXX, and those charges were due XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, Chase ordered the refund check, deducted ALL of the current charges in the amount of {$3700.00}, and sent me the difference in the amount of {$4600.00}. AGAIN, the charges of {$3700.00} were NOT due until XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nI believe it is not Chase 's decision to make when I decide to pay the charges on my account ( which again weren't even due until XX/XX/XXXX ). AND, it is not Chase 's decision on whether or not they can take the FULL amount of the charges of {$3700.00}. I could have made payments on those charges if I wanted to because it is my card. \n\nThe account was in good standing, it was not closed, and if I decided to pay minimum payments on the {$3700.00}, that would be MY decision, NOT Chase 's. \n\nThis has to be illegal. Chase can not make that decision for me! I received a telephone call from Chase and a follow up letter stating that they sent me the refund balance of {$4600.00} instead of the {$8300.00} because there were charges made after the refund/credit from the auction posted to my account..",
