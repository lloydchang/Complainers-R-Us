I made my first payment and then noticed I had received an interest charge.The store had a small sign to confirm this promotional offer however I was told about it when making my purchase, which was the reason I opened the account, I have tried to contact the company via chat today XX/XX/2024 to have them honor the 0 % or reverse the interest charge and I would just pay the card off. The chat has been disconnected multiple times and I have spent more time figuring this out. I was unable to contact the creditor over the phone and I am just upset because I never would have opened this account had I did not qualify for a 0 % rate even though the store employee had told me I would qualify.",
