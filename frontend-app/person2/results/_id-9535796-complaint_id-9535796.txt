I have paid consistently on time and sometimes more than the minimum. I did not know what the interest rate would be after that time limit. I was too happy that they allowed me credit to get my eyes fixed so I trusted the company. I noticed with time that I was being charged interest and assumed maybe I didn't understand so I let it pass. Until I saw my statement for XXXX with an accrued interest of {$850.00} on my balance of {$1000.00}. I talked to a representative and she said that was what had accrued because I did not pay in full the balance. I did some research and discovered that the company was charging more than XXXX XXXX interest rate. I dont know what the original interest rate was that they charged me because they wont give me the XXXX-year statements. If there can be anything done to reduce that interest rate, I would really appreciate it. Thank you for your help. XXXX XXXX",
