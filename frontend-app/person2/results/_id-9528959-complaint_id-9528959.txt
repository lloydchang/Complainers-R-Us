Before I left the XXXX, I visited a Wells Fargo branch to close my checking and savings accounts, paid the outstanding balance of the secured credit card, and subsequently called the phone number on the back of the card to cancel it, which I believed the card will be canceled accordingly. I moved back home in late XX/XX/XXXX and have since never used this Wells Fargo credit card. However, I moved back to the XXXX a few weeks ago and I found my credit score to be substantially low for no reason. I requested a copy of my credit report from CFPB and discovered that Wells Fargo not only did not close my credit card but it had posted a balance of {$160.00} in XX/XX/XXXX, when I had already left the country thinking the credit card had been closed. I have tried to call customer service at Wells Fargo on the phone to file a dispute about this, and they told me to mail the requested information to Wells Fargo Credit Dispute Department, and I will receive a confirmation of receipt from them in a week, I did so and XXXX tracking showed my package was delivered to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX, but I have not received any notification since then.",
