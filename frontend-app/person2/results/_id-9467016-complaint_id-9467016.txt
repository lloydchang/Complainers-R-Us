  "complaint_what_happened": "U.S. Bank appears to have finished disputing the incorrect charges, something I've informed them of in writing numerous times prior to them completing it, and the subject of complaint XXXX. A complaint they haven't responded to. I have since sent them detailed itemized lists of the charges that need to be disputed, including all order numbers and purchase details, and pointing out where they gave me money while searching for appropriate delivered items to claim I disputed. I offered to do this during the initial phone call but was told it wasn't allowed ( recorded ). I find it hilarious and ironic that in an effort to accuse me of fraud, they gave me credits for items that arrived. They seemed to stop trying when I sent them all the relevant order confirmations and tracking showing they were disputing the incorrect charges and those that needed disputes. You can tell they decided what they were going to try and cheat me out of beforehand, because that's the balance they reported to the credit bureaus on XX/XX/XXXX when my balance was - {$7000.00}. Then they reported {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX when my balance was - {$1600.00}. They appear to have spent XXXX making adjustments to get my balance slightly above XXXX $ come XXXX when they reported my account closed a month prior. The balance as reported to the credit unions on XX/XX/XXXX does not match the balance I screenshotted on XX/XX/XXXX. It is also too high given the retailer credits I received afterwards. It has since been adjusted after numerous complaints to various organizations, but is still to high. They appear to be ignoring the dispute communications. I will be submitting disputes to all three credit bureaus by weeks end if they do not respond. I retain all communications to and from them to include recorded phone calls.",
