Citibank now intends to reverse the credit and re-charge me for the fraudulent transaction, citing their inability to assist. The merchant failed to offer any explanation or counter-evidence, yet Citibank allowed this to happen and announced the closure of the case. This is unbelievable! And how could you release the funds without considering my perspective initially? Dont I have any rights? \n\nAs a reputable and well-established financial institution, I am confident that Citibank has a strong legal team capable of handling cases of fraud and protecting its clients from such unethical practices.
