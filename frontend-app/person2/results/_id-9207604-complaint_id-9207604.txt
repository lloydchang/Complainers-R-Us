The emails report the % of balance used, when the balance is paid and come from XXXX. So somewhere my first name and our email are connected to an account that is not mine ( I do not have any accounts with Chase ). We have called Chase several times and they keep transferring us between fraud, customer support, and tech support and say they can not do anything about it.
