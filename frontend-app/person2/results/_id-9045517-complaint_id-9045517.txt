  "complaint_what_happened": "I had not been receiving my bill from Bed and Bath and was under the impression that my account had been paid off. I paid {$220.00} XX/XX/XXXX and {$220.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I realized my automatic payments had stopped and I contacted Bed Bath and Beyond via telephone to make sure my balance was XXXX. I was told I had a balance and I could do the final payment, this conversation was on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXXXXXX XXXX. I was able to reach the representative and she stated she could take the payment over the telephone and I would not incur a fee and it was prior to the due date. She attempted to make the payment for me and the system was going into an infinite loop, the same that I had experienced when trying to make the payment online. She told me she would notate the account and go ahead and send the payment from my bank account and I would not incur a late fee because the system appeared to be down. I went ahead and did the electronic payment to come out of my account on XX/XX/XXXX. I was still a bit confused on how I still had a balance on the account because I'm usually very good at paying over the amount with the credit card company owing me and it made sense to me that the two payments I had made was a split of what was owed plus interest. Anyway, the payment was processed for {$65.00} via bill pay because I couldn't remember the exact number I was told of the balance. I setup a payment for {$10.00} on XX/XX/XXXX because I didn't recall if I had a automatic billing on this account and again on XX/XX/XXXX. I figured the credit card copy would owe me a credit. I contacted Bed Bath and Beyond to receive my credit and they informed me I still had a balance on my account which consisted of two {$35.00} late fees,. I asked how could that be? They stated my XXXX payment did not reach them until XX/XX/XXXX. I was perplexed and asked to spreak with a supervisor in which there was not one available, I was told to call back. I called back the same day and inquired to spreak to a supervisor and was informed the company was in bankruptcy status and they could not reverse the late fee and a late fee would be assessed every month. Mind you, I had an overage in the payment and they informed my payments were always due on the XXXX, Somewhere along the line, my payment due date had to shift. My end of year statement shows XXXX late fees and looking at my payments, I have always paid {$220.00} near the end of the month. Community Bank is very much in business and this practice is definitely manipulative and unfair. I also sent an email to Community Bank and have not yet received a response. I have copies of the payments, telephone logs on the calls, and unfortunately, my statements have not been sent or received on a regular basis and it appears they can't send XX/XX/XXXX- XX/XX/XXXX statements. Thank you!",
