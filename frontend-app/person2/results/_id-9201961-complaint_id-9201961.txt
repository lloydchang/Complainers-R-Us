The clerk took the payment and I asked her XXXX times if I was going to be charged a late feel, and she said \" no ''. I asked if I would be charged for making the payment over the phone, she said \" no ''. XX/XX/XXXX, I was checking my account and noticed I had a late fee charged! I called the company and spent XXXX XXXX minutes on their automated system only to find out they were closed. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX dealt with their system again and it closed my account. It's impossible to reach a live person. When I finally get through, I spent over XXXX minutes with \" XXXX ''. I explained XX/XX/XXXX to her and she checked and said my account was closed and called me confused. I explained the automated system did that. She stated that I had called after XXXX XXXX and that's why I was charged a late fee. I asked what it took to pay my account off and she said it would take {$330.00}. I also requested to be removed from the mailing list and receive something in writing stating my account was closed and I've been removed. She said I would. I never did and I continue to receive their catalogs every day. I also sent a message through their website which goes to comenity. Their response was I had an outstanding balance of {$4.00} for the month of XXXX and a {$2.00} finance charge was added. This was not true at all. The {$4.00} was a finance charge which I didn't understand because I closed the account before the due date 10 days. They say my account was already closed so they can't credit me any fees and they are continuing to add charges. My account is paperless so I was, in good faith, believing that my account was closed and that I owed nothing until I received an email in XXXX saying I needed to make a payment. As stated above, I recorded the conversation from XX/XX/XXXX because at that time I didn't trust them any more. I don't know how to attach that.",
