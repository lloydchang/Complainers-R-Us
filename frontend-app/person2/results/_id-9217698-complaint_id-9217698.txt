  "complaint_what_happened": "I had a credit card account with Citizens bank. I was listed as an authorized user under my mothers account. I have absolutely no online account access. Every time I called, they gave me a hard time even to retrieve account balance information. After submitting a payment for the account balance, the XXXX payment I made was returned for some reason. I had no idea it was returned at all since Im not even listed as the primary account holder and I dont receive any type of notice in terms of the account balance as an authorized user. I tried downloading the app and was still not able to retrieve my online card info. The company immediately passed off the balance we had to debt collections and immediately closed my moms credit card for alleged suspicious activity. No idea whats going on, but weve have had this credit card for awhile now and have always paid on time. My mom uses it as a travel card and I use it as miscellaneous charge card. This is actually the 1st time I have actually used it and brought the balance up to {$150.00}. The account balance was immediately paid when I was notified about the payment being returned. My mom used it last year for travel costs and brought the balance up to {$1500.00} and has paid the balance off in full. She actually just received notice about the reasons for closing our account and the notices are dated for early XX/XX/XXXX, so there recently issued notices. \n\nI definitely find it unfair that they closed our account. They also passed on the debt to collections and didnt even give us a notice about this at all and/or provide any accommodations. Normally, a consumer is at least granted 30-days to be notified of any issues/resolve any issues. I think its unfair that as an authorized user, I can not even have online access and that I do not receive any type of notification in terms of account balances, payments details, etc. When I tried calling to retrieve account balance and pay the account balance in full, the 1st representative that I spoke to gave me the incorrect balance to pay and transferred me over to another to assist with my account. The 2nd representative that I spoke to advised that the credit account wasnt closed and the current balance was a lot higher. He did assist me with submitting a full payment and I had no other issues at the time. The primary account holder just received notices and just relayed the info to me on XX/XX/XXXX about the account closure. The notices we received are dated for XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX. I definitely think theyre being suspicious in term of how they operate business and/or treat their consumers.",
