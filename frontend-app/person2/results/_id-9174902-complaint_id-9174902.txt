I know this is not a large amount but I was not aware of a fee for exchange rates and I feel like this is unfair and abusive fee. None of my other credit cards charge this fee so I called to ask that they do a one time courtesy waiver for me and they refused. Im sorry but that is pretty petty on their part. Ive been a customer for many years and spent thousands of dollars on this card and they cant even waive one small fee for a loyal customer?? This is beyond acceptable and predatory. I just want the fee removed or I will close my accounts both credit and checking.",
