  "complaint_what_happened": "During the course of having services with Citicard in XXXX XXXX of XXXX there were several occasions where money that was set to transfer from my bank account to go towards my monthly credit card payments & balances to make the Citicard account reflect to a {$0.00} amount would always have a weird system error. Ive escalated the calls several times & many times the agents would hang up the phone in my face. Id call back several times in a day & theyd claim the system had an error due to Covid & the payment would reflect within XXXX hours. Sometimes theyd refuse to give me their name or badge number & talk with a loud, criticizing tone & hang up the phone again. Id have to argue my point of how would they feel if their money just kept disappearing & still no results. Id get transferred several times, escalate the calls & several hundreds of dollars wouldnt reflect on the account ever. Sometimes, theyd put some money on there but not the entire balance of what I paid & it would make my account late, & credit score go down because they wouldnt upload all of the money I sent to them before the due date. At this time, offices were closed so I couldnt file anything in court or complain to the proper chain of command. They would ultimately use a language barrier as protection to steal money from me since they were of an XXXX descent. I requested for my account to close & was left with a ridiculous balance that was paid beforehand. I simply paid it XXXX  years later on XX/XX/XXXX in order to have the entire irritating account deleted. The agent agreed that this would be a pay for deletion account. He lied because not only did I pay this company throughout the timeframe I had services with them ( to not build my credit as they didnt advertise ), they actually stole my hard earned money & didnt hold up to their standards of what they advertised which was a second-chance credit card opportunity as a secured card. They stole from me & took advantage of someone who had a low credit score at that time all because they have a big name. Its fraud at its best. I had faith this company would assist me in my hour of need as long as I displayed loyalty through on time payments & they did the opposite. The agent also lied that this would be a payment for deletion & it wasnt when I tried to pay them for the last time. For the months of XXXX XXXX the payment history reflects as positive. But on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, & XX/XX/XXXX are negative months on my report for negative non payment months. XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX are good months for payments as well. Their payment history is senseless, reflects incompetence, inaccuracy & contains scribble-scrabble that definitely have lies included as well. They had negative remarks on my account & changed them once my dispute letters were sent to them via certified mail. Now they are debilitating my account more by reflecting negative payment history remarks that are untrue & inaccurate. Its as if they want to want to try to keep my credit profile purposely with a low score or poorly remarked no matter what when their professionalism & accuracy on their end has been at an all time low from the start. They didnt rectify closing my account properly even after the certified letter was sent to them & they have been just doing what they want to with my account. Ive attached the before comments that they had on my credit profile & the after results of what they call themselves correcting. If they were doing such a great job then why remove comments etc & update them after I sent my certified letter to them. I can give a slight clue & thats because they had no intention of doing the right thing from the beginning & just take advantage of the individuals that may not have the time or knowledge on how to fight back to go against their scams. I want this account closed completely & this nightmare over asap!",
