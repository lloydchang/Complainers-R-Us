'' I took advantage of the promotion expecting that the {$2200.00} charge would be immediately applied to the new credit card ( as shown in the promotion ) because I was instantly approved.

I called and spoke with at least XXXX different people at Citi and XXXX XXXX trying to figure out why I could not apply the payment to the new card even though it was approved and the line of credit was open. I was advised that I would have to wait up to two weeks until the physical card came in the mail before I could use it for ordering my airline tickets. \n\nI was not in a position to wait to order the tickets as they had already gone up {$200.00} since the other people in our group ordered them just one day prior. Not to to mention I was already 90 % complete with the ordering process. The entire promotion was SO misleading- I would NOT have taken advantage of the promotion had I known I wouldn't be able to put the tickets on the Citi XXXX XXXX Credit Card at that exact time. There was NOTHING in the terms & conditions that said the card couldn't be used until the physical card arrived. I did a quick online search and it appears that other people have had this exact same experience with this credit card promotion!! Also, I requested a copy of the terms & conditions and did not receive any detailed information about the promotion that I was offered.",
