  "complaint_what_happened": "I signed up to become a member of a ( scam ) company called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. No specific date was given for when we would receive access to the \" member store '' online or get our \" debit cards '' but at sign up it stated 2-3 weeks. At the end of 2 weeks they extended the date another 2-3 weeks, and so on and so forth for about 4 months. The company kept hosting XXXX  meetings whereby they moved the date of releasing the membership cards and website/store access. Different excuse and explanation, but very believable so I kept holding on waiting for my \" merchandise '' access card to arrive so I could utilize the benefits I paid {$490.00} to become a franchise on my chase debit card On XX/XX/XXXX, the company sent an email stating they were ceasing operations. I immediately filed a dispute with Chase for non-receipt of merchandise. Even through it has been more than 120 days from the purchase Chase 's polic it has NOT been more than 120 days since the company promised us our cards and website access that had been continually delayed due to \" numerous issues '' and it has NOT been more than 120 days since I was notified that the merchandise would never be sent. On XX/XX/XXXX Chase denied my claim for the 120-day rule. I called a manger and explained that although it was 120 days from the purchase, it was NOT 120 days from the \" new '' date of the promised product to be sent. I told the manager at Chase that I never received any request from Chase to provide documents. My XXXX  XXXX  also paid {$25.00} each on their debit cards to get tranzact cards which they also never received. In XXXX we received email from the company stating that the new company launched named XXXX, and we were all transitioning from XXXX to XXXX and access to the member deals would be coming soon. They continued to promise to mail cards, during their zoom meetings but I never recorded the meetings. \nI believe Chase is being abusive in their application of Regulation Z, because the time clearly starts following when the product is to be delivered/received. In this case, the \" delivery '' date was moved every few weeks, so we were never more than 60 days outside of our promised delivery date. I have filed an FTC report about the fraudulent company : XXXX This is run by a man with a history of securities fraud ( \" We also reported on XXXX being criminally charged with securities fraud in Utah back in XXXX. The charges pertained to XXXX running two Ponzi schemes, which authorities claim XXXX defrauded consumers out of ~ {$10.00} XXXX dollars through.
