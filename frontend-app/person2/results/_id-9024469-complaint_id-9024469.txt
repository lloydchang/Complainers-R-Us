  "complaint_what_happened": "On XX/XX/XXXX, Shop Your Way Mastercard, sent me a letter stating that I owe {$110.00}. This is a bill with the transaction date, XX/XX/XXXX. This is bill from a purchase from XXXX. XXXX received the payment through the Mastercard, and they even gave me a refund for not delivering the correct items in the amount of XXXX. I gave this company all the information and they still have not given me any clarification. In the meantime, Citi, the issuer of the XXXX suspended my charging privileges. My online subscriptions were all canceled, and I reported fraud on my account. In the meantime, I had No card, but the company continued to give me three different account numbers, but I had No card. The statement came in, but I told them, How is there purchased with No card? The harassment continues. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Shop Your Way stating, Since you have initiated a dispute on your Shop Your Way Mastercard account, we have adjusted the Minimum Payment Due so that you only need to make a required payment of {$62.00} by XX/XX/XXXX. This adjustment reflects the portion of the balance that is not being disputed. On XX/XX/XXXX, they say that they issued a credit for a charge ( s ) disputed as unauthorized along with any related fees and interest. And if I dont hear from them within 90 days, the credit will be permanent. I just got a card in XXXX. I have only use this card for my online subscription for XXXX XXXX  {$7.00} and XXXX XXXX, nothing else. These people are Very abusive, the same women in customer service changes her name many times, from the fraud department to other departments in customer service. They even manages multiple credit card companies, because they know my name, and I know their voice. They even canceled a order that I had with Macys. They renewed it, because its wasnt Macys its them. They lie, harass me even though I have been a holder of this card since XXXX. I have always paid off my statement balances and on time. Please, the Fraud is within this customer service department.",
