There was a charge of {$1400.00} and a charge of {$2.00} posted under Adjustment. I immediately contacted the credit card company, and while their fraud department couldn't locate the \" Adjustment '' amount, they suggested it could be a chargeback reversal. I informed them that I did not initiate any dispute for {$1400.00} or {$2.00}. Because I never made any purchase for {$1400.00} After some discussion, the credit card company informed me that they would escalate the issue to their senior fraud department, and I should expect a credit within 14 days. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I followed up with the credit card company, and this time, they told me that the {$1400.00} and {$2.00} were transactions made through XXXX XXXX. They provided an email receipt XXXX. I explained that I did not recognize the email address and that I had never made a payment of {$1400.00} to anyone using XXXX XXXX. \n\nWhile I do use XXXX XXXX, my account has a limit that doesn't allow me to send more than {$400.00}. I brought this to the attention of the credit card company, but they didn't have an answer. I went through all of my XXXX XXXX purchases with them. \n\nI had previously opened a dispute with the Best Buy credit card for {$200.00} from XXXX XXXX, which I acknowledged and lost. I questioned how a {$200.00} chargeback could turn into a {$1400.00} charge. I emphasized that I did not recognize the {$1400.00} charge or have any association with it. \n\nI urged the credit card company to review my transaction history from XXXX to XXXX to check for a charge of {$1400.00}. They could not locate such a charge, and I am still trying to understand why it was added as an adjustment to my account. \n\nThere is an error between the XXXX XXXX and the Best Buy credit card. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could investigate this issue. It appears to be a fraud case, and my credit card company is not providing the assistance I need. \n\nI want your team to investigate and ask the credit card company to reimburse me for the fraudulent charge on my account, as it has significantly impacted my XXXX XXXX. This error by the Best Buy credit card has caused me great stress, and I should be compensated for the inconvenience. \n\nI have attached the following documents. \n\nXXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX statement.
