After about a week, they decided that I was liable for the charges and reposted them on my account. The issue being that apparently their system shows that a chip was used when making the purchases and I had let stated that I had not lost the card nor lent it to anyone. \n\nDespite filing a police report, a claim with the Federal Trade Commission and a fraud alert with XXXX, they continue to deny my assertion of fraud. The charges occurred in multiple cities where I was not present. I have requested a letter from my employer stating that I was working on three of the four days the transactions occurred to try to further my case. Unfortunately, one charge occurred on a Sunday so I would need to get a letter from the church where I was attending services at the time. Three transactions were in XXXX where I do reside but hopefully the fact I was working on those days will suffice. Several of the charges were for large amounts and I was never contacted by Wells Fargo to inquire about possible fraud given that all were unusual charges given my account history. \n\nThe charges are as folllows : XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX - XXXX {$250.00} XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX - XXXX {$240.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$56.00} XXXX XXXX - XXXX {$14.00} XXXX - XXXX {$6.00} XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX - XXXX XXXX {$60.00} Big Daddy 's - XXXX ( XXXX charges ) {$98.00}, {$79.00}, {$78.00}, {$76.00} XXXX XXXX - XXXX {$1900.00} XX/XX/XXXX : Clevelander - XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) {$600.00} Big Daddy 's - XXXX ( 2 charges ) {$230.00}, {$120.00} XXXX 's - XXXX {$100.00} XXXX - XXXX {$22.00} These charges total {$3900.00} ; all of which are fraudulent. \n\nI have made every effort to work with Wells Fargo to prove that I did not authorize these transactions and they continue to deny my claim.
