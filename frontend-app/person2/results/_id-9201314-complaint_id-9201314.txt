  "complaint_what_happened": "On my XX/XX/year> credit card statement, there was an unauthorized charge dated XX/XX/year> to XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX Georgia ( where I reside ) for {$510.00}. I reported it as an unauthorized charge, the charge was temporarily reversed, and the company issued a new credit card. On my XX/XX/year> statement for the newly issued card, there was an additional unauthorized charge from XX/XX/year> to XXXX XXXX XXXX  for {$1800.00}. I reported that charge as unauthorized and they issued a XXXX  card. They then referred the XXXX unauthorized charges to their Fraud Department which has steadfastly claimed that the charges were legitimate, that I received services from XXXX XXXX XXXX on both of those occasions, and that I was responsible for paying those charges. Additionally, they have repeatedly claimed that my credit card was 'physically present ' on both dates and that I 'benefitted from services ' at XXXX XXXX  XXXX. \n\nUntil those charges appeared on my credit card statement, I had never heard of, nor had I ever done business with, XXXX XXXX XXXX. I located and visited XXXX XXXX XXXX where I was given documentation that showed that no charges for those XXXX amounts were made on those dates at XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, and that my credit card had never been physically presented there. I provided this information on several occasions to the credit card company. The company claims that they thoroughly investigated the disputed charges, although they never contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX  which would have resolved this dispute months ago. \n\nTheir contention is that because my credit card has a chip, it can not be replicated and yet there is information available indicating otherwise. In addition, even if my credit card had been physically presented ( which would have been impossible since it was in my possession ), I did not authorize those charges. My understanding is that consumers are not responsible for unauthorized charges and I certainly did not authorize either of those charges no matter how they came to appear on my credit card statement. \n\nTo further substantiate my claim, I was out of town on XX/XX/year> ( the date of the second unauthorized transaction ) for the entire day. I left town before XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX opened, and returned after XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX closed. My credit card statement clearly shows that I used the card twice that day in XXXX different cities : I could not have been in XXXX places at the same time, nor could my credit card have been physically presented to XXXX XXXX XXXX  on that day. \n\nFinally, I have used this credit card company for at least XXXX  years and I have paid the balance in full every month regardless of the amount. Because the credit card company has reported the unpaid balance for these fraudulent charges, my credit score has dropped from XXXX to XXXX. This is unconscionable. This is the ONLY blight on my record in all my XXXX  years. I am asking that this dispute be resolved in my favor and as quickly as possible. \n\nThank you so much for your prompt attention and help in resolving this matter.",
