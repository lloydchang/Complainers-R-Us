A follow up call on XX/XX/XXXX, they said wait 3 wks coz nothing was done. XX/XX/XXXX, still nothing was done ; they said wait 7 to 10 days. Its now XX/XX/XXXX, We were told to wait another 10 days. They authorized the check XX/XX/XXXX. It was a total of 2mths before they surrendered this money back to us. Today, we talked to XXXX badge XXXX. I asked him to read me the history of my calls since they claimed Im being recorded. XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX somehow disappeared on his log, which I doubt. The excuse they came up with was theres no authorization from the card holder, when we were both talking to them. When the XX/XX/XXXX call was made, they finally released the check on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX told us, a consideration was made to release the check without authorization. This is theXX/XX/XXXX I caught him with. We asked him this consideration couldve been done a month ago, but chose not to. ( that excuse was also XXXX coz my husband was present the whole time and given me permission to properly address the issue ) For them to hold our XXXX for 2 months and make us plead with them to send this back is beyond belief. The customer service has failed us to the highest level. Corporate office should address this problem and Id like to know that something is done.",
