When the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, they immediately charge a late fee of {$30.00} or XXXX. They do not even give a XXXX day grace period. But my specific complaint is that they do not give you any payment reminder whatsoever before your payment is due. They wait until the XXXX when the late fee is charged to your account, and then XXXX or XXXX days later they send you the following text message : \" Carecredit courtesy reminder. Make payment .... '' If this was actually a courtesy reminder, why wouldn't they send you this text reminder XXXX day BEFORE your payment was due? The only logical answer is that this is very purposely engineered that they give you no reminders before you payment is due because they are hoping to be able to charge you a late fee. There is no other reason why they would wait until XXXX day after the late fee is charged to give you a \" courtesy reminder '' to make a payment, except that the timing is very much deliberate because it results in them collecting more late fees. \n\nIf you take into consideration that I am someone with close to an XXXX XXXX XXXX who has no derogatory marks on my credit because I am careful to pay all my debts, but even someone like me, since I have a lot of credit cards sometimes miss a due date and am XXXX or 2 days late and this has affected me already 4 times this year, XXXX how many of their customers are being charged these late fees because of their deliberate practice of giving you NO PAYMENT REMINDERS until AFTER your payment due date, combined with the fact that they immediately charge you a late fee at XXXX, with XXXX grace period. This is a predatory banking practice that is purposely harming their customers. When I pointed this out to them they removed only one late payment and had no answer to why there are no reminders sent before, only after late fees are assessed. \n\nDates is that I was charged a late fee are XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX of this year.
