They said you need to use the convenience check-without explaining a XXXX % fee to utilize the promotion. I originally used the promotion when I bought a refrigerator from XXXX in 2014 or earlier, there were no fees. I just made the check on Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX for a XXXX bill. Today I checked my account to see when a payment would be due, well payment due on XXXX XXXX with the added XXXX % on my balance. I called them a third time to try and clear this issue, no way and no reduction of interest rate-currently XXXX % when my credit score is XXXX. \nI told them these were unfair financial practices since they advised me to use the check without explanation of fees in order to utilize promotion. I told them I wanted to cancel because I have cards with lower rates or XXXX  % on a XXXX or XXXX bill. I don't think I owe them XXXX  %. By the way it's a Citibank Mastercard.",
