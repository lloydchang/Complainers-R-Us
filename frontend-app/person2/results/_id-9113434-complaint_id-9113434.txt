Until then I started to use this card and had a balance due on around {$3200.00} as of today. Couple of weeks ago I contacted Barclays bank about this offer, but they denied and said there is no such offer. Again I contacted them multiple times ( emails/calls ) and finally they requested the proof of this offer. I send them the original invitation on XX/XX/year> where the address they provided through the email. They received the original proof and unfortunately still denying the cash back bonus offer on this card. \nAlso I contacted XXXX today and they said Barclays Bank is responsible. That means none of them are helping to solve this issue. Basically this is cheating, the bank took all information 's including my social security for credit check. Due to their default action I didn't receive my bonus and also my credit score lowered. So please make appropriate action against this bank to receive their promised offer. Thanks,",
