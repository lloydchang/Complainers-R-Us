On XX/XX/2024, I received a call from the college stating that the charge was filed as a unauthorized charge and that they will be returning the funds and replacing the balance of XXXX back to my student account. On XX/XX/2024 I received an email from cash app stating that my claim was denied. I then called cash app and asked why was the claimed denied, when the school said that they reversed that transaction and put the charges back on my student account for entire amount of XXXX. Seems unfair and predatorily wrong on cash apps behalf. if the funds were returned then that is my money how can my claim be denied if the money was returned. I have been using cash app for a long time, and they didnt even try to help me solve this matter any other bank would have went above and beyond to help a loyal customer.",
