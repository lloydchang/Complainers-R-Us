On that day I purchased two items from XXXX that were properly identified as separate transactions for two different vendors with a reference number and description paid by my XXXX XXXX card. There is no record of the {$1200.00} on XXXX and I cant file a complaint on XXXX. I have asked Goldman Sachs to trace the charge back to XXXX to identify the vendor to determine legitimacy because it is fraud but they wont. I suspect the problem may be related to Apple making Goldman Sachs the default credit card overriding my XXXX XXXX card. I had to go to the system app on my XXXX to designate my XXXX as the default credit card. Apple is directing a lot of business to Goldman Sachs and I did not apply for the card like I did with my other credit card.",
