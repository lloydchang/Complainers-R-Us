This explanation struck me as odd and I went to review my monthly statements ; upon review, I noticed that due to me diligently paying my account, I had not been charged any interest. When I confronted the rep about this he essentially said that the frequent payments caused me to spend more than my credit limit. This makes absolutely no sense, because no single transaction ever amounted to more than my credit limit. My suspicion is that Aspire closed my account due to their inability to charge me interest, in addition to their annual fee. Lastly, any cash back that I earned by paying my account diligently is being held. I consider this to be malicious, fraudulent and discriminatory conduct. Any help regarding this matter is greatly appreciated.",
