  "complaint_what_happened": "I have been a customer of AMEX since XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from Amex asking me to upgrade my current credit card. I agreed and they processed the card. My understanding from the conversation was it was an upgrade to my existing two cards ( everyday card and blue card ) by increasing the credit limit. But in actual this upgrade was to a XXXX credit card that has a membership fee of {$690.00} annually. I was not informed about this fee during the phone conversation. Then one month later I got a mail that had a platinum card in it. I was remarkably busy and did not bother to activate the card. A few days later another card was sent to me. I got confused. Then a new monthly payment statement showed up. I opened the statement, and it shows two charges, one {$690.00} for the first card and another {$190.00} for the second card totaling {$890.00}. It says both charges are membership fees. First, I am not a business traveler or a XXXX XXXX banker to ask for such luxury cards that have a fee in it. Secondly, I have never made a request for a second card. It was simply pushed to me. I was really upset and this past Sunday before I went to church, I made a phone call to Amex customer service. I spoke to five different people explaining to each one of them that I have never subscribed for such a card that has a membership fee and asked them to remove the charge. They all refused to listen and address my concern. I am not stranded with a fee of {$890.00}. I am not willing to pay this fee. I did not receive the service., I did not want to be part of it and asked them to cancel the XXXX card. They cancelled the card, but the fee is my responsibility according to Amex. I would like the US government to stop such predatory banks and credit card firms from misleading customers. Kindly request your office to resolve this issue. If this fee is not removed my credit score will be affected because I will not be able to pay this illegitimate charge. \nThank you. \n\nXXXX XXXX",
