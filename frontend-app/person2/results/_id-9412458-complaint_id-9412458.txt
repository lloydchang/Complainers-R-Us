I called FNBO on XX/XX/XXXX and asked about the transfer and why my balance wasn't appearing. They seemed to indicate that everything properly transferred, however after some back and forth, admitted there was an error in their system and it would be fixed in a timely manner - that has not happened. I called XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX, and they said there was no record of my history on their end and I no longer had access to statements or documents. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, and they said there was no longer any record of my account, that it has been transferred to XXXX XXXX, and due to security reasons, they could not answer any additional questions. I'm not sure why it showed her XXXX XXXX on her end, as the card clearly exists under XXXX. To follow up, I called FNBO on XX/XX/XXXX, and asked for an update - they reiterated that the transfer was complete and recommended I wait until the statement clears ( XX/XX/XXXX ). At that point, they said if the balance was the same, nothing could be done. \n\nI meticulously track my records but unfortunately do not have any statements from XXXX or XXXX related to this credit card. I do however, have all the payments I ever made on that account to cover my balance ( see attachment entitled Credit Card Payments ). They total {$5600.00} from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. Every transaction completed on that card was for a utility or internet bill, as this was my designated card for that purpose, so all of it would qualify for the 5 % category.
