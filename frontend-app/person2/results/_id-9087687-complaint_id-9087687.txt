As my credit card of your company, TJX Rewards Card offered by Synchrony Bank I do not care the mentioning about the rewards certificates which I could not use at all. It just frustrating and annoying to see the receipts which I can not recognize at all. Some of them which indicated as I bought, I could not figure out what it was from the beginning. I do not know what XXXX  XXXX XXXX was ( XX/XX/XXXX24 ). I remember I bought a lot of clearance frames which was {$1.00} each wishing I would use for my XXXX. The sale of frame ( XXXX XXXX XXXX {$8.00} ) might be that one. However, I believe I have bought more than 8. I do not know what XXXX  XXXX  XXXX ( {$6.00} ) is. There is another XXXX  XXXX ( XXXX {$15.00} ), which I do not know since I am not an employee of XXXX. The Jewelry/watch XXXX and XXXX must be the clearance silver bracelet or something and one   made in XXXX earrings XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX24, and I do not know what XXXX XXXX ( XXXX {$9.00} ) is on XX/XX/XXXX24. I remember I bought several throws which were under {$30.00}, even though they were more than {$100.00} ; even though the designs were not my favor. But they were 100 % cotton and made in USA. Another one was an XXXX rabbit one for children. It was originally {$30.00}, and with a reward certificate {$10.00}. I loved to find out the secret treasures in XXXX, XXXX. XXXX, XXXX. Now, it is XXXX and boring, since there is no fun to get something cheaper with rewards. Since the card was closed, I do not care what your company depicts how the certificates have been used. Just XXXX employee ( s ) made some fake receipts. You do not have to explain about how I can get reward anymore since I do not have your company card. The explanation is disgusting. Since the website account, which must have been mine, disappeared ; therefore, it is useless to mention I can use the certificate ( XXXX ) in either paper or paperless. As far as I remember, TJX Rewards or XXXX company gave me {$10.00} gift card at the beginning. Since XXXX related so many companies, I lost the trace. Then, I complained everywhere. And at least {$20.00} reward certificate ending in XXXX was replacement certificates of some of unused {$10.00} certificates. I have with them, but I do not want to check which ones were originals. \nI am not sure whether somebody hacked or not as you stated. What I can say is the account is closed, and I do not have the card ending XXXX. And I receive some letters and emails related with a card ending XXXX. Since I have never asked your company to issue the replacement card, I do not owe any card ending XXXX. From the beginning, I need to request why a card ending XXXX exists. And I have one concern whether your company can say I will not receive any more letters for card ending XXXX, especially a bill. I still go to this shop XXXX on XXXX. XXXX, XXXX, but not so often. I only buy clearance foods and the shop is worthy for that. \nI receive the letters from XXXX and XXXX, and emails from XXXX asking me my identification documents, even though I never requested any service from them. I sent identification information for them for security freeze. Maybe, because your company provided my address to these agencies without my consent, they are sending the letters. As far as I understand what these credit report companies state only under my request, they can issue the documents. If you provide my address and personal information, I think you leak my identity. As a victim of identity theft, I consider it is serious. Therefore, I report it to the federal agencies. \nSincerely,",
