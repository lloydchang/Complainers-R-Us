  "complaint_what_happened": "On XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a XXXX washer, washer machine hoses and extended warranty online with Lowe 's. Online order # XXXX, Invoice # XXXX in the amount of {$690.00}. In addition, I was charged a {$50.00} fee for Lowe 's to pick up the broken washer. The washer was delivered on XX/XX/XXXX. After using the washer the day of delivery, I noticed the washer was awfully loud and vibrating. I proceeded to the XXXX 's store located at XXXX Elysian XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, La XXXX the following day XX/XX/XXXX, and explained the issue with a representative in the appliance dept. On the same date XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a XXXX XXXX washer in the amount of {$470.00} ( Military discount- {$24.00} ) extended warranty {$86.00} and tax {$52.00}. The receipt showed a delivery date XX/XX/XXXX for a total of {$610.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX the XXXX 's drivers showed up to pick up the XXXX washer that was previously purchased online on XX/XX/XXXX but they said they did not have a XXXX washer to deliver that was purchased XXXX. I immediately contacted the customer service number and was told the delivery date for the XXXX washer would be XX/XX/XXXX. I returned to the same XXXX 's store and spoke to XXXX ( XXXX ) and explained I couldn't wait that long for a delivery and the purchase was cancelled. {$470.00} ( washer ) + {$44.00} tax for a total of {$510.00}. I later receive d a check in the amount of {$95.00} dated XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX which I assume was for the extended warranty that was purchased but have not deposited or cashed with my bank as yet. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX I don't have a washer from Lowe 's. Then I started receiving bill statements from Lowe 's showing a balance of {$1600.00}. I have contacted their customer service dept and filed several complaints on numerous dates, but the issue still has not been resolved through Lowe 's. I then contacted Synchrony Bank which is the credit card company responsible for issuing Lowe 's credit cards and spoke with someone named XXXX in the XXXX XXXX. She told me to fax the purchase receipts for the XXXX washers that were purchased in addition to the receipt for the XXXX washer that was picked up on XX/XX/XXXX and the receipt showing the cancellation of the XXXX XXXX washer. I was instructed to include XXXX different case numbers provided by her. Case # XXXX for {$690.00} and case # XXXX for {$610.00}. I was told XXXX 's was still charging for a washer that I did not have, and the receipts were needed to correct the dollar amount. I faxed all receipts and required paperwork needed to Synchrony Bank/CCG Department XXXX XX/XX/XXXX that included a total of XXXX pages. A disputed amount of {$28.00} for freight charges would have to be handled by the fraud dept which later credited me {$28.00} and cancelled the existing credit card and issued replacement cards. The billing cycle from XXXX is the first bill I received after the purchases, have continued to receive monthly bills since then and email notifications informing me that the transactions are under investigations, ongoing investigations, that the dispute has been resolved several times only to receive the most recent Lowe 's bill dated XXXX showing a previous balance of {$760.00} + Interest charge of {$21.00}, {$1.00} paper statement fee and {$30.00} late fee for a total of {$820.00}. This information will be reported to the major credit reporting agencies if not resolved. I have tried contacting their corporate office only to get an answering service referring you to contact customer service. \nI called customer service on XX/XX/XXXX and was told to contact the online dept or dispute the transaction with the merchant. I called Synchrony Bank today XX/XX/XXXX, and was transferred to the fraud dept, explained the issue, was put on hold and then the representative came on the phone repeating he couldn't hear me after XXXX minutes on the phone. I hope that this issue can be resolved by your company and if more information is needed, please let me know. Thank you for your assistance with this matter. \nI'm unable to scan documents but if provided a fax number I'll gladly fax the necessary documents.",
