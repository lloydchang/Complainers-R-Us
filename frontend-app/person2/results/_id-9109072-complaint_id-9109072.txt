Unless Synchrony can provide me the original agreement for this charged off account I suspect I dont owe them anything at this point. I have been harassed by random collection calls at all hours of the day several times a day until I told them its my right under the FCRA to not be harassed. I had to get a XXXX subscription and filter all of my calls just to be able to use my phone regularly. I have had several issues like this in the past with Synchrony where their billing systems would create problems or other issues and I would close those accounts due to it. It seems that Synchrony is very predatory and likes to trample on peoples rights while selling them junk they dont need on Amazon then causing them undue strife after communicating that our financial situation was tenous bc they saw that as a weakness to exploit. I definitely feel exploited through the whole process especially since Amazon has been reported to have inflated prices on their market",
