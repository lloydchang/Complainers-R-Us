I believe that American Express has not honored the terms of their promotional offer and has provided inconsistent and misleading information. \n\nHere is a detailed timeline of events : XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX : I registered for the rewards activity via the American Express mobile app. \nXXXX. XX/XX/XXXX : I contacted online customer service representative XXXX to confirm my registration for the \" XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX - Earn a Free Night Award of XXXX points after spending {$4000.00} or more '' rewards activity. XXXX confirmed that the activity period was from XX/XX/XXXX, to XX/XX/XXXX ( a XXXX period ). \nXXXX. XX/XX/XXXX : I reconfirmed the spending progress and the activity deadline ( XX/XX/XXXX ) with another online customer service representative, XXXX. \nXXXX. XX/XX/XXXX : I completed the required spending of {$4000.00}. \nXXXX. XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX : I contacted online customer service representatives XXXX and XXXX, respectively, to verify if I met the requirements for the rewards activity. Both representatives indicated that some processing time was needed and could not provide immediate confirmation. \nXXXX. XX/XX/XXXX : Upon contacting multiple customer service representatives, I was informed that the activity had actually ended on XX/XX/XXXX. According to them, I had not met the spending requirement by that date, and therefore, the reward would not be issued. \n\nI have kept records of all my interactions with American Express representatives and have consistently received conflicting information. Initially, I was assured that the activity period extended until XX/XX/XXXX, and I planned my spending accordingly. However, the recent contradictory information stating that the activity ended on XX/XX/XXXX, has left me without the promised reward despite fulfilling the spending requirement within the initially confirmed timeframe. \n\nI am seeking your assistance in resolving this matter. I request that American Express honor the terms initially communicated and issue the promised reward. Additionally, I believe this issue highlights a need for greater transparency and consistency in the information provided by American Express to its customers. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution. \n\nSincerely, XXXX",
