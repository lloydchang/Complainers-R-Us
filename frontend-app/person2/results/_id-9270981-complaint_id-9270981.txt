  "complaint_what_happened": "Citibank has greatly disappointed me. I have funneled over XXXX XXXX XXXX dollars in the past year of my hard earned money through Citi and I have been a proud ambassador of the Citi XXXX XXXX card. To my chagrin, Citi up and reduced my credit limit on XX/XX/XXXX because of a late payment ( a few days ) and them randomly pulling my credit and stating their action was as a result of their review. I have a stellar payment history. The month of XX/XX/XXXX, I had heavy travel assignments that resulted in me not being near my personal computer and as such missed XXXX payment by a few days ( I paid it as soon as I realized ). Citi then decided to halve my credit limit consequently negatively affecting my credit score and making my utilization look really bad. I am making this complaint because XXXX months later, Citibank repeated their action, but instead of XXXX card, on XXXX of my XXXX cards with them and there was no late payment. Here is a detailed summary of my observations relative to Citibanks unfair practices : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Credit card ending in XXXX with a credit limit of {$18000.00} - On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email notice informing me of this action from Citibank XXXX There was a recent review of your account and credit information. As a result, we have revised the credit limit to {$9900.00}. Your current account balance is {$9600.00}. My credit utilization on that card therefore went from 53.7 % to 97.6 %. I called at least XXXX  times and made inquiries and complaints, to no avail, Citi upheld this decision to negatively impact my credit score. Over the ensuing months, and out of concern for my utilization rate, I aggressively paid down on the cards balance from {$9600.00} to {$4500.00}. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX XXXX Credit card ending in XXXX with a credit limit of {$9900.00} - On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email notice informing me of this action from Citibank XXXX There was a recent review of your account and credit information. There was a recent review of your account and credit information. As a result, we have revised the credit limit to {$4700.00}. Your current account balance is {$4500.00}. My credit utilization on that card therefore went from 53.7 % to 97.4 %. \n\nXXXX Credit card ending in XXXX with a credit limit of {$31000.00} - On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email notice informing me of this action from Citibank XXXX There was a recent review of your account and credit information. There was a recent review of your account and credit information. As a result, we have revised the credit limit to {$12000.00}. Your current account balance is {$12000.00}. My credit utilization on that card therefore went from 39 % to 97.5 %. \n\nConclusion and request of Citibank I am writing to file a double barrel complaint related to both usury and discriminatory practices by Citibank. My payment history will show on time payments for a period extending beyond the past XXXX years. Should Citi have thought to make a decision that would greatly impact not only my credit score, but also my access to credit, they should have had a conversation with me first and not made assumptions based on algorithms. I am greatly disappointed in Citibanks decisions and would like to request that Citibank cease and desist from these unfair practices and immediately reinstate my credit limits subject to me making on time payments and at least making the minimum requirements which I have been doing consistently. This unfair action has caused me a great deal of distress and disappointment. If Citibank is unable to favorably consider my request, I will consider taking my business elsewhere. Coupled with me utilizing Citibanks credit facilities, they have earned thousands of dollars in interest payments from me as well as me evangelizing their XXXX XXXX card to several of my executive friends and associates. I do plan to similarly share my negative experience if Citibank does not reconsider their unfair action. I would also mention that I have access to {$25000.00} and more of credit with XXXX XXXX  XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX, none of whom have taken the action of Citibank hence my conclusion that Citibanks practices are unfair and summarily Usury and discriminatory. I am also making this complaint on behalf of others who have suffered this same unfair and discriminatory action which is meant to harm my credit score and access to credit without even so much as a conversation or some amount of notice of intended action with some required action prior to an adverse event. This hurt me so badly that I do not feel as though I have confidence that Citibank understands the credit behavior of customers such as myself. I am a highly successful XXXX who used my credit facilities during a time of entrepreneurship and am doing even greater things in the next XXXX months. Shame on Citibank for not caring to be service oriented and just treating customers as a number on a screen. I have been with Citibank for the past XXXX years.",
