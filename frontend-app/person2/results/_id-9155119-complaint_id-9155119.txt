I request this case be reopened and a follow up for my response. Here are 6 questions/concerns : 1. Their response states I didnt set up an auto-pay payment plan. Yet I set up the payment plan via phone call. Its all in the recorded call. In the call, the agent stated I was enrolled in auto-pay for minimum payment. They provided 0 information of this in their response. Thus, I request a review of the call with the agent. How can I receive this information/how can we confirm you review the call?\n\n2. You stated my payment plan was opened XX/XX/XXXX. The first payment that was missed was XX/XX/XXXX. All of those payments in between were on-time and NOT manually paid. It was all autopay. So please explain how I wasnt enrolled in auto-pay?\n\n3.I cross-referenced my bank account linked to PayPal payments and it had sufficient funds for the dates you state I missed payment and indicated in your response. Thus, if my account was on auto-pay as it shouldve been AND as mentioned in the call AND as it was for months prior, there would be 0 missed payments. So why wasnt it charged autopay? Or did you guys cancel the autopay?\n\n4. Your response states I shouldve received CAP emails. Which of my emails were they sending notifications it to?\n\n5.Has PayPal/Synchrony sent me any lawsuit letters for this collection? \n\n6.A quick investigation on PayPal/Synchrony within the past years shows that they have canceled auto-pay for individuals ( unbeknownst to the customer ) and have caused mishaps with peoples payments. You can actually see people complaining about this right on the PAYPAL COMMUNITY section on PayPal.com here : XXXX XXXX XXXX \n\nAnother example on Fico websites where customers have submitted complaints on this as well : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX All that said, this case needs to be reopened and I need a proper and thorough investigation into the call where we agreed I would be on auto-pay. In addition, I have proof the on-time payments were done via auto-pay charges and not manually. So we need to further discuss this. Please answer all questions and AWAIT my answer instead of closing the complaint.",
