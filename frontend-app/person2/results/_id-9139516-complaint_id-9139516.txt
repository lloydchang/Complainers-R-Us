  "complaint_what_happened": "Good morning, My name is XXXX XXXX / XXXX XXXX Ct / XXXX XXXX / Fl / XXXX. \nI received notification that my payment was due on a card I have not used since XXXX XXXX XXXX. I logged into my account to discover that it showed 60 days past due on a {$XXXX} charge. I paid my balance in full per the creditors online website on. The website for my credit card stated I owed a total amount of {$XXXX} ( statment balance/total amount due ) no later than XX/XX/year>. I made the payment in full on XX/XX/year>. This is before the billing cycle ended and I should not have owed additional money. This card was then stored away for safe keeping and recorded by me as paid in full. It is now being reported to the XXXX credit bureaus as delinquent by 30 days and then again as 60 days and I feel this is more than inappropriate and unfair to me as a consumer. No contact was made to resolve this issue timely to avoid this and has created a significant impact negatively on my XXXX XXXX and payment history. I have had 100 % on time payment history for almost a decade and worked extremely hard to maintain that for myself and my family to better our credit/financial oppoortunities. Now I am in the process of shopping around for home builders and contractors to accomodate my aging mother living with myself and my family and feel this will hurt my chances to accomplish this therefore negatively impacting my family life and my abilities to take care of my mother. I am requesting that someone please assist with this complaint that I have as I am getting no resolution. I tried contacting the original creditor but when speaking with a customer service representative about the unfair credit reporting and in my opinion a fraudulant balance owed of {$XXXX} I was refused the ability to be able to speak to a XXXX or XXXX when I asked. I paid what they stated I owed due to the negative experience and fear of the continuation of negative reporting if I did not pay. I feel this company fraudulantly charged a finance charge after a billing cycle end date on a XXXX balance and in return should be held accountable and responsible to correct this for me. \nCreditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CXXXX XXXX ) XXXX Accounty Number : XXXX Statement attached for more detailed reference. \n\nI would appreciate any assistance and your time. \n\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX",
