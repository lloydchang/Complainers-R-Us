However, your agency has failed to provide the requisite documentation to substantiate the claimed debt, thus violating My natural person and/or ESTATE and/or ESTATE ASSETS, property rights under the FDCPA. In an effort to pursue possible litigation with any of the following information responded to without delay, this discovery request is supported by your duty and obligation as the indentured party and/or fiduciary, and/or intermediary and/or custodian of record as this matter is coupled with an interest! \n*Please note, that THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT STATEMENT evidences the extension of credit, there has been no evidence on any record to my knowledge as to funding of the loan, which means you are in direct violation of federal law and statute as noted above as well as 82 Stat 152, 153 and other applicable laws and/or principles of law for and of the United States of America XXXX XXXX You will provide proof to the contrary, or I will prosecute your bond and the insurance company responsible therefore and thereof, in Small Claims Court for said violations! \n\nIN EXCHANGE for : Your communication evidences An exchange, that My ESTATE received something of value in return for consideration or vice versa, I ( shall always be inclusive ) have no evidence of FUNDING, and since you have brought forth a claim that there is evidence of an EXCHANGE.

My ESTATE having no evidence of such funding, only evidence of a CONSUMER CREDIT TRANSACTION, and the extension of credit does not evidence the loaning of funds as defined in law that could substantiate any claim whereby debt collection and/or foreclosure proceedings may commence without furnishing proof thereof! \nLegal Definition and Requirement of Debt Validation : The FDCPA mandates that debt collectors must provide comprehensive validation of a debt upon a consumer 's request. This validation entails a detailed accounting of the debt owed, including but not limited to a signed affidavit or a legally binding declaration that confirms the accuracy and ownership of the debt. The absence of such documentation directly contravenes the stipulations set forth by the FDCPA, rendering any attempts to collect said debt not only unethical but unlawful. \nViolation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act : Your continued efforts to collect this disputed debt without providing proper validation are in direct violation of the FDCPA, which protects consumers from abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices. The Act stipulates a clear moratorium or stay on collection activities upon the dispute of a debt, which your agency has blatantly disregarded. \nFailure to Disclose Liability Insurance Information : Moreover, your refusal to disclose your licensing and bonding information, upon our request, inhibits our ability to file a claim for damages caused by your non-compliance with the law. This information is critical for pursuing legal remedies and is a requirement for businesses engaged in debt collection activities and/or practices, to maintain. Your agency 's failure to provide this information further evidences a disregard for legal obligations and consumer rights. This communication will serve as a final attempt as to obtaining such information within 15 calendar days of receipt! \nGiven these circumstances, Iam left with the choice to pursue legal action in small claims court against you collectively and/or individually for failing to validate the disputed debt as legally required and for your continued collection attempts in violation of the FDCPA. This action will seek not only to address the violation of SECURED rights under the FDCPA but also to claim damages for the harm caused by these unlawful practices. \nImmediate Corrective Action Required : I demand immediate cessation of all collection activities related to this account and the provision of the requested validation and insurance information. Failure to comply will result in legal proceedings without further notice. \n\nINTERROGATORIES : INTERROGATORIES ( are to be answered contextually, without regard to typo, sentence structure and/or grammar. Everyone is deemed to know the law, everyone is deemed to have a reasonable understanding of law, the following is founded on the maxim i.e. : principles of law, please be advised )-",
