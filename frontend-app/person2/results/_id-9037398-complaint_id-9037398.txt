I transferred this amount because the interest rate was cheaper and and I thought I could pay it off sooner. I have learned that my $ XXXX balance is now $ XXXX and will keep increasing until I pay off my $ XXXX purchasing that happened way after the fact. I think this is a ponzi scheme to keep the banks rich. I does that make sense that is no better than a loan shark. I am inundated with emails about referring friends etc but nothing about how my $ XXXX transfer has not gone down in 2 years but has in fact gone up by $ XXXX. That does not seem right and should not seem legal.
