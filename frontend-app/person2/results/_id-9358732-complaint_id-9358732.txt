During my visit, I applied for a Costco Credit Card. I was provided with the Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi Application Documentation and Card Agreement, which included a Card Agreement and Privacy Notice.\n\nApproximately 30 minutes after submitting my application, I received an SMS text message indicating that my application had been declined. The message stated that I would receive a letter within one week detailing the reasons for the denial.\n\nAccording to 15 U.S.C. 1691, the ECOA prohibits discrimination against applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age ( provided the applicant has the capacity to contract ), or because all or part of the applicant 's income derives from any public assistance program, or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.\n\nI believe the denial of my credit application was unjust and discriminatory, infringing upon my rights under the ECOA. As a consumer, I have the right to apply for credit and be evaluated on fair and equitable terms. Furthermore, the issuance of an Adverse Action Letter in place of the credit extension is an unauthorized use of my credit information.\n\nI am requesting the following actions be taken : A detailed written explanation for the denial of my credit application.\n\nAn investigation into whether any discriminatory practices occurred during the processing of my application.\n\nA reassessment of my credit application to ensure it is evaluated fairly and in compliance with the ECOA.\n\nI trust that Costco Wholesale Corporation and Citibank , N.A . will take this matter seriously and respond promptly to my concerns. Please provide the requested information and any relevant findings within 30 days of receipt of this letter.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt and thorough response.",
