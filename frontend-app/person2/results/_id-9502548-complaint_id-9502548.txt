Despite closing the account, the card continued to appear under my checking account, although it was inactive. This situation persisted for years. \n\nAbout a year ago, I opened a new credit card account with Bank of America and began using it. A few months ago, I made a payment of {$200.00} toward my credit card balance. Since my new credit card account did not appear on my online banking page and only the old, closed account was visible, I mistakenly sent the payment to the old account. Despite the account being closed, the bank accepted this transaction and deducted {$200.00} from my checking account. \n\nA month ago, I visited a Bank of America branch to resolve this issue. The customer service representative assured me that I would receive my {$200.00} back within XXXX days. He also asked me to log into my account on my laptop and then deleted all information related to my old credit card from my account, which I did not request. \n\nToday, I visited another Bank of America branch to follow up on this issue. However, XXXX XXXX, the bank representative, informed me that I need to provide information about my old credit card account to resolve the issue. Since the information was deleted by the previous representative, I am unable to provide it. I believe the bank should have records of this account and should be able to assist me in retrieving my funds without requiring information that was deleted by your staff. \n\nI request your immediate assistance in locating my {$200.00} and refunding it to me as soon as possible. This situation has caused significant inconvenience and frustration, and I expect prompt action to rectify this error. \n\nPlease contact me at email XXXX to confirm receipt of this complaint and provide an update on the resolution process. \n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter. \n\nSincerely, XXXX",
