My payment is due monthly on the XXXX of each month and when I made XXXX 's payment on XX/XX/year> they said I was XXXX days late. This was not XXXX days late only XXXX days late. I called some of my other Credit Report companies to ask them how that work, and they said if you make a payment on the XXXX of each month then your next payment is not due till the XXXX of the next month. Then they all stated your late starts the day after the due date which would have been XX/XX/XXXX. That wasn't 30 days but I tried to discuss the situation with Comenity Bank, but they didn't care, didn't want to listen to me nor to try to resolve this issue. You can not talk to the exact people who handle the credit disputes, and you have to mail paperwork and they said just dispute it. Comenity is a terrible company and I'm already on a hardship for XXXX months and they know it but don't even appreciate that I'm keeping the bills paid on time due to me losing my paycheck. Never in my life have I been XXXX days late on anything and I will never let that happen. I want this removed immediately.",
