Right before we were starting the descent path into XXXX, the flight attendant made their service announcement about a one of a time special offer regarding the XXXX credit card. On this announcement, they said that this had never been done before and that for anyone who would apply for the XXXX credit card, that they would get an additional XXXX miles on top of the XXXX miles that came with the credit card. \n\nBesides this, they also stated that we would get 24 flights at the cost of just XXXX miles per flight, as long as the flights originated in XXXX to any other destination or fly into XXXX. In this regards, they announced that flying from XXXX to XXXX XXXX would cost just XXXX miles each way. \n\nIn their speech, they also stated that were would be no fees associated with the credit card and that their XXXX was among the lowest in the industry ; however, they never mentioned what was the average. \n\nHaving heard all this, and the offer to fly into XXXX XXXX from XXXX at just XXXX miles per fligh, I decided to apply for their credit card as this was a great offer to me. To my surprise, when the credit card arrived home, I realize that everything that was mentioned on that flight by the flight attendants were complete lies and false advertisement. The credit card is not free, there is a {$79.00} annual fee ; their APR is not among the lowest in the industry since their APR is a whopping 28.24 % and there were no free miles unless the credit card holder would make {$1000.00} worth of purchases within 90 days of account opening. \n\nFeeling fooled by their sales tactics and lies, I contacted XXXX XXXX and they told me that such promotion did not exist and that the only option was for me to go to the airport and speak to a representative at the airport about this offer that was made on my flight back home. Feeling devastated that I had to go into an airport to complain with a ticket agent, I proceeded to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX today, who is the issuer of the XXXX credit card to complain about this and they told me that there was nothing they could do for me. That all they could do was to close my account, but knowing how bank operates, I said to the representative that doing so would have a negative impact of my credit report and score to which he acknowledged that it would.",
