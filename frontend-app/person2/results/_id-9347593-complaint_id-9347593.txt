The agents upon calling kept stating it was an issue with the systems & it should reflect within XXXX hours. The payments of hundreds of dollars if my hard earned money would just vanish. The same happened to my XXXX  account. So we requested to close the account after making the final payment. Wed escalate calls, contact other numbers to try to speak to corporate & because of XXXX no one would contact us back & theyd hang up in our faces as well. I thought of suing them but the court system was shut down as well. They were taking advantage of consumers that were simply looking to restore credit for their financial needs. Fast forward XXXX years later this account is on my report & I want this faulty account that has received their payment numerous times to be removed. Ive spoken with them numerous times, sent letters & not one person remedied the problem. They just keep lying. My husband even paid a balance he knew he didnt owe & they lied & said it was a pay for deletion & its been XXXX years & still on there. So why would I trust theyd not do the same to me.",
