We understood that delivery would take place in the not too distant future. We were notified later that the washer & pedestals were not yet available but they would deliver the dryer with the washer and pedestals would come later, which we agreed to.

Next at a later date, another damaged dryer was delivered. We refused delivery. This happened yet again and we refused again. Then they delivered a damaged washer. We refused delivery yet again and canceled the entire order when prompted to do so if we desired. So they removed their dryer and we sought out a different vendor. During this time span, we paid on the Citibank card regularly, XXXX payments totalling {$400.00}, not to mention the original cash payment of {$1200.00}, which we reasonably expected to be refunded.

Since they have refunded the {$1200.00}, cancel the balance due and refund our {$400.00}! We had already disputed the balance due as well as the {$400.00} to Citi and the man agreed that it was a simple calculation and there really should be no dispute.
