The credit card statement closes on XX/XX/XXXX of each year, not my choice of closing date. This year when my Citibank business card closed on XX/XX/XXXX they awarded me with mileage but not the LP loyalty point, claiming they have to sort out the spending prior to XX/XX/XXXX which may only exclude 1 day of spending and my XX/XX/XXXX statement shows total spending of $ XXXX in mid XXXX to end of XXXX, plus XXXX transaction on XX/XX/XXXX which is the capturing date not the date of spending. Before XX/XX/XXXX my total LP was XXXX, about XXXX LP from the Top tier XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( LP of XXXX, {$200000.00} spending during a QY ), pending the LP End of Year deposit of XXXX spending. I have been calling the XXXX  XXXX  numerous time since XX/XX/XXXX when I found out they only awarded me the mileage, but not the LP. Then when I talked to Citibank credit card people, they realized they missed the LP, they told me the LP will be deposited to my account within XXXX days. To my surprise they did it the next day or so, but they put my {$26000.00} spending prior to XX/XX/XXXX into the new QY as XX/XX/XXXX spending, instead of XXXX spending and my XXXX XXXXXXXX status become XXXX tier lower than the XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX which only requires {$120000.00} spending in one QY. There goes my rewards benefits also and I have spent almost double the $ spending just to obtain a lower XXXX Status. I have spent the next XXXX  months or more calling the AAdvantage program and nothing have been done except they created a follow up request to verify my XX/XX/XXXX statement spending are before XX/XX/XXXX, which could have been done by a XXXX way call with Citibank credit card people. I have forwarded my Citibank statement to XXXX people but they said they can't accept my statement to do any changes and have to be the bank people make the change. Despite my constant calling, the follow up request changes from taking XXXX weeks to XXXX  month to longer and no progress or changes made. I feel like the loyalty program changes from time to time so as to create loopholes so their staff can be negligent and consumer can be cheated and deprived of their deserved status, rewards and benefits. I have been told by XXXX people that the request has been escalated again and again, but I have to call them to find out the result of the follow up request, what is the point? Then I have to request them to request the Citibank people to change it? They are the XXXX people but can't change anything about the program matter? That's an outright kicking and fooling me around and cheating me of the benefits that I deserved!! That's why I resort to filing this complaint to let consumers to see what have happen to me and need to plan loyalty program a bit in advance, may be request a closing date well in advanced of XX/XX/XXXX or whatever that may be. These programs only care about your spending but when it comes to reward they drag their feet and fool you around because there is nothing I can do despite all these phone call, Felt cheated, despaired and helpless after spending all these money.",
