While we were able to pay the remaining balance and close the account, for anyone not in a position to do that would incur unexpected fees and interest charges with little warning.

This company appears to suck you into a great no interest for 18 months then charge you late fees for not making any payments which they claim to be waived for the initial 18 months.
