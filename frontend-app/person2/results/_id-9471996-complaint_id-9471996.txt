  "complaint_what_happened": "I remitted the statement balance on the account on XX/XX/year> in the amount of {$100.00} representing the full balance owed on the Citicard Shell Master Card. On XX/XX/year>, I was notified by the company that the payment had not been received, 30 days after remittance. I then re-issued and mailed a second check for {$190.00} which represented additional and subsequent charges as well as the earlier remitted statement balance of {$100.00}. At that time I requested waiver of the {$29.00} late fee as well as accrued interest which was honored, confirmation received. Citicard services again contacted me subsequently on XX/XX/XXXX via \" late notices '' stating that the account was past due and that there was not record of the second remittance for {$190.00} mailed XX/XX/year>, some 9 days earlier. Being annoyed with the now two \" missing '' remittances, I sent in the cut up credit card to effectuate closing of the Shell MasterCard account. This account 's history reflects that I have never had issue with or had never been remiss in making timely payment of the entire balance before payment was due. Yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to a XXXX of the Executive response team regarding this matter. She firmly told me that the processing center had NO RECORD of either payment remittance. Yet, at XXXX today XX/XX/XXXX, I received an e mail thanking me for the {$190.00} payment and that it was being processed, now 24 days subsequent to the mailing of the remittance. CitiCard 's processing center is delaying processing of payment remitted and is effectively \" losing '' customer remittances. This appears to be an overt effort on their part to generate late fees and interest to inflate revenues in a possibly fraudulent manner. As of yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, I stopped payment on both remittances allegedly missing and unreceipted and reissued my payment in full, less the stop payment charges assessed by my credit union, {$25.00} per check.",
