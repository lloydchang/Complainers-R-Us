Bathrooms are a nightmare and were never completed. Lowes stopped doing bathroom and kitchen remodels. They said this can only be settled through Synchrony. Original bill was {$22000.00}. In XX/XX/XXXX balance was {$18000.00}. I had already paid {$47000.00} by this time. I am 80 years of age and had never made a late payment. I contacted Synchrony Bank in XX/XX/XXXX and was told to file a dispute and just stop paying on the bill and cancel my card. I am now receiving mail every week, phone calls everyday all day demanding I pay off this account. They are penalizing me by canceling my Sam 's card which is also through Synchrony and ruining my credit record which has always been excellent.",
