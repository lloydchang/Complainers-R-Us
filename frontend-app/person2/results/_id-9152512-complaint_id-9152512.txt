  "complaint_what_happened": "I had 2 accounts at Bank of America. One was in use and one was not, but both showed up on my account web page. Once several months ago I had made my payment and accidentally clicked on the wrong box and the payment posted to the wrong account, the one with a XXXX balance and not to the account being used that had a balance due. I received an email that my payment was past due but knew I had made it. I went to the webpage, saw where the payment had posted to the wrong account, called Bank of America and explained what happened and while on the phone with them they transferred the payment to the correct account and removed the late payment fee. I asked that the old account be closed and removed from the webpage so this didn't happen again. They closed the account but did not remove it from the page and I made a payment in XXXX XXXX XXXX  and once again clicked the wrong box and the payment posted to the wrong account. I didn't realize it until I got a payment overdue email from them a few days later. So I called again, told them what happened and how it had been corrected before. I once again asked that this second account be removed from the page so this didn't happen again. The young lady I spoke with said she could not move the balance over and that I would have to make another payment to the correct account and she could not remove the late fee. She said they would mail me a check for the credit balance on the other account and I should receive it within XXXX days. During the call we were disconnected so I called back and spoke to a young man and told him what happened and he said the same thing. A check would be issued for the balance within XXXX days but I would have to make another payment to the other account. I told him I would pay the active account off IN FULL, including the late payment fee, and for them to immediately send me a check for the {$300.00} credit on the closed account. I asked that they also close the current account and take me off their mailing list as I would never do business with them again. He assured me a check would be sent and that the active account would be closed once it was paid off. The account has been paid off but 2 weeks later I still had not received my {$300.00} back. I called again and the lady I spoke with said she had no idea why I had been told what I had as they do not issue paper checks. She said she would start an inquiry and I should hear something within- AGAIN - 7 to 10 days. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and I have not heard a thing. I want my {$300.00} issued back to me. My current account has been paid in full and has a {$0.00} balance and the 2nd closed account still shows a {$300.00} credit balance.",
