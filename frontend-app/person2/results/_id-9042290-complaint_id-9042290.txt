I am a senior citizen, and I don't like going paperless. I only pay an occasional invoice when my husband assists me to make a payment, he uses a password generating system, which I find too difficult to use and it's only on his computer. I am XXXX years old, and I have a pristine credit score, but I typically prefer to get my bills by mail, as does my husband, and pay them by check. I think it's even more bizarre that the notice said, if I charge less than {$2.00} a month, there would be no paper bill fee of {$2.00}, but honestly the insert in my statement was so confusing I am not positive that this is the case. This lunacy however, it did seem confirmed when I called the credit card company to complain. I feel like charging {$1.00} monthly just to irk them, but instead I took the credit card out of my wallet and will no longer use it. I think this {$1.00} fee for NOT going paperless is discriminatory to seniors and low-income people with no home access to computers and have to rely on public wi-fi in public places, or the library where others may be more easily be able to hack their account information. This fee practice for paper bills should be illegal.",
