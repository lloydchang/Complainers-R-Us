  "complaint_what_happened": "My experience with PenFed has been a disaster. About a year ago I got a second telephone line for mobile service. I wanted to isolate my banking business from the non-bank business. I tried to make an online payment to PenFed using my new number and was told I couldn't do that for \" security reasons. The phone number on my new phone didnt match the one on their records. I made numerous attempts to find out how I can change my old number to my new one. The PenFed story was I would have to send any recent household bill to verify my address and to simply write my new phone number on the bill. Despite this ridiculous proposal, meaning the Pen Fed solution, I went ahead and did that, including a USPS Registered letter. If their mail service is so unreliable, perhaps they should stop making their online payment so hard to use. They don't have an Email address that customers with questions or complaints can access. I find their advertising gimmick of being there for veteransinsulting. Please keep in mind that I made regular payments through USPS with a personal check being my only option. It was also the only entity I had business with that I had to use this antiquated method. PenFeds most recently questionable business scheme was to double my XXXX monthly payment by, not only, accepting the check that had cleared after approximately 10 days, but they also accessed my checking account without my approval or arrangement saying it was a payment for the same period my check was for. This meant that PenFed, which for that month wanted a minimum payment of about {$100.00}, managed to extract {$350.00}.\n\nThat same month, XX/XX/2024, the same bill had a charge placed by the XXXX  for an XXXX membership internet and a phone number XXXX. The amount was {$45.00}. I never agreed to this nor did I place an order online.\n\nThe following day PenFed sent another letter saying the method/Information I used to allow me to make payments online was insufficient for identification and I was given yet another phone number, no Email address. The method I used, in other words, a bill with my name and address and the new number on it, that was their idea, wasnt good enough. Are you starting to see the pattern Im seeing?\n\nIm sending this same letter, by request, to the State of Missouri, Office of the Attorney General, Fraud Division. Im going to leave out the internet membership charge to the XXXX, in part because I dont want to believe the XXXX would do something like that to a member and a veteran.\n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX",
