Chunk:
a statement been generated for me to pay yet, or in other terms i was still within the grace period. this is in my opinion unconscionable and wrong, while those charges i had yet to be billed for would ( eventually ) indeed have a normal 21 % apr, they shoud not in my perspective be absorbing any of my payment, because those charges have not even been billed to me yet, this feels absolutely and entirely preditory in nature and i believe this practice ought to be either outlawed, or a consumer should have the right to allocate their payment as they chose, not as barclays not only defaults to, but when i called i was told there was no one at barclays who could amend the allocation of my payment. they have chosen how to apply my payment in a way that benefits them, and only them, and it is clearly not in the consumers best interest. i have now had to pay { $ 2100. 00 }, more than what my current stated balance is, because i also have pending charges from recently using my card today, that i have to make sure i cover those sums as well to avoid paying interest.
