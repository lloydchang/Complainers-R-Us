In fact, my entire credit limit is {$XXXX}. \nI was told that I should call back in a few days to see if adjustments had been made to the interest amount. When I called back today, XX/XX/24, I was told a waiver request had been denied because I changed my payment due date, so I was still being charged an interest fee on the {$XXXX}. Ok, so I changed the due date, but I still don't owe {$XXXX}. I have never owed that much. This time, the rep said the only thing that could be done was to request another waiver to see if it would be approved this time. I asked how was the {$XXXX} determined, and the rep told me that, since I changed my due date, the interest rate included all purchases made from the original due date to the new due date. My original due date was the XXXX of every month, and I changed it to be the XXXX of every month. That change was requested in XXXX, and since XXXX, my entire amount due has only gone from {$XXXX} TO {$XXXX}. How does that explain the XXXX statement being charged interest for {$XXXX}?
