Chunk:
around noon yesterday, i logged into barclay's to make a payment. i entered the payment information, and it took me to confirmation page. i realized that i needed to move money into my checking account first, so i did not confirm the transaction. i did not proceed. later in the day, i returned to my computer and found the barclay's web page had timed me out. i logged back in, re - entered my information, and confirmed transaction. i confirmed a total of one payments. i did not confirm two payments. why would i make two identical payments? i called barclays and asked that they waive any fees associated with second payment being returned by my checking account bank. i asked that they remove any derogatory information from my account related to the duplicate payment being returned by my bank. the barclay's agent said there was nothing she could do - despite the problem arising because their web site proceeded with a transaction that was not completed.
