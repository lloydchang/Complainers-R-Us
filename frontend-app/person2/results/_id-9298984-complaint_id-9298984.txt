  "complaint_what_happened": "XX/XX/year>, I called Macy 's American Express to inform them that XXXX XXXX XXXX  had scammed me on the purchases of Tickets. XXXX positioned itself as the XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX. I immediately caught the discrepancy when they sent the charge and called their number indicated to cancel the charges. It was a foreign location, and the person could not understand English very well and kept me on the phone for almost 30 minutes. After I spoke with them, I called Macy 's American Express and informed them not to accept the charges. Macy said they could not dispute or stop the charges until AFTER they had been posted. I was told to call after the charges had been posted. This seems to be very unfair to the Consumer since AM EX received notice before the charges were accepted that it was a scam. As per the Complaint XXXX sent to you XX/XX/year>, I contacted them to not send the tickets because of the predatory additional charges in excess of {$300.00}. They did not reply to you. They sent what I assume were the tickets to me which I did not open and returned to them. I sent an email to XXXX support, and it was returned to me undeliverable. They vanished. I purchased the Tickets from XXXX XXXX XXXX within that hour with a {$6.00} service fee. My complaint to you was sent to FTC. Macy 's American Express has refused to refund me the {$470.00} XXXX charged me on this scam. I have attached their reply, dated XX/XX/year>. They have charged my account. SECOND ISSUE : As you will see in the dispute sent to AM EX on XX/XX/year>, I requested that Macy 's AM EX not to increase my credit limit automatically. If they did, I told them I would not be responsible for charges on that account. In XX/XX/year>, Macy 's AM EX increased the credit limit without my approval. It is very hard to have regulations that protect the Consumer like me. It seems that Unchecked Capitalism favors the Corporations and Billionaires. Over 70 % of American are living on credit cards and the interest rate is extremely high. The Credit Card companies are giving credit increases in order to tempt consumers into even more debt and poverty.",
