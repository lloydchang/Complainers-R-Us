If so, please call them which I did and they asked me to temporarily unfreeze my credit so they could verify the information they were seeking. I did that and while I was on the phone with Barclay representative I was told my card had been approved and it would be coming to me. It showed up in the mail some days later. I activated the card and had it on my desk to use for an upcoming cruise In XXXX, XXXX. \n\nI have several letters to support what I write below. On XX/XX/XXXX an unauthorized {$1000.00} balance transfer was initiated by Barclay from a long-held XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ) credit card of mine. {$1000.00} flowed to the Barclay Visa and Barclay also charged me a {$50.00} fee. \nI DID NOT AUTHORIZE THIS transfer and don't know how it happened.\n\nA few days later I checked my credit cards and was surprised to see the transfer to the Barclay Visa. I contacted Barclay was immediately transferred to the Fraud department. I was told it was suspicious that a credit card I applied for in XXXX had triggered a letter to me in XXXX. The same day they shut down the account number and ordered a new card number and reissue of the card. Barclay agreed to return the {$1000.00} to XXXX.
