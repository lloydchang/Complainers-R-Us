Recently I made a purchase of {$1600.00} for a business conference I am going to in XXXX. However, I used the wrong credit card ( my XXXX XXXX ). I called the merchant and asked for them to refund the purchase so I can use my ShopYourWay Mastercard to get the {$70.00} promotional credit. While on the phone with the merchant they advised I could go back online to make the purchase or they could simply take my card number right there. I had a brain lapse and completely forgot about the online piece of the promotion and gave them the card number over the phone. I then called customer service, told them the story, and asked them to make a one time courtesy adjustment given the hoops I'm going through to use the card to get this promotion, and they wouldn't help me, so I am now submitting this complaint in hopes that you'll help. Just so you can see I am not making up some looney story, I attached a screenshot of my XXXX XXXX - still awaiting for the credit to hit. I've also attached screenshots showing that making the purchase online is clearly an option.",
