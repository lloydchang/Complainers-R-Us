This makes no sense, as the account supposedly no longer exists and has no remaining balance owed on it. I have contacted them but just got spun in circles about how this is because this amount was paid before. However, they could not address how an inactive account is pulling money. Between the closure of my account with no forewarning, the forfeiting of my points with no warning, and an attempt of a closed Wells Fargo account to pull money out of my checking account, this is now fraud on the part of Wells Fargo.
