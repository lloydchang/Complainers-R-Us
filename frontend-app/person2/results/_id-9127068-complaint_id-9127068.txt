The answer I got was they reviewed my customer profile and decided to close the account. My checking/savings account attached to this had over {$90000.00} currently. They closed it and sited the terms would have to change, meaning the APR or interest rate. Im now supposed to reapply at a higher cost. This to me seems like predatory lending, looking for ways to increase a fee for current customers to pad the bottom line. I want my card to reopened at the same terms. I also never agreed to have my credit reviewed, this was not approved and caused a hard inquiry on my credit profile. Please help in this situation.",
