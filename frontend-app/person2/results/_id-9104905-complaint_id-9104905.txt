  "complaint_what_happened": "I purchased flights from XXXX ( XXXX ) to XXXX ( XXXX  ) and then XXXX  to XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) on XX/XX/2024. The flights will be on XXXX XXXX. I made the purchase using points and cash through American Express ( AMEX ). On or around XX/XX/XXXX, I asked to make a schedule change after I closed my card. Now I'm being bullied around by the company and I can not make the change.\n\nOriginally, when I made the change request, I tried making it online at XXXX XXXX ' website. It would not allow me and told me to call AMEX. So I did. They told me they could not help me and to call XXXX. So I did. A rep from XXXX  told me they could not help me and told me to call back to AMEX. So I did. On or around XX/XX/XXXX, an AMEX rep created a case saying I'd need to pay {$50.00} or so to make the changes. She said someone would call me back to finalize the change. But it never was resolved. I'm now about 4 hours into being on hold from various phone calls and starting to get frustrated.\n\nI had a friend offer to use their AMEX card so I could pay to make the change. I called AMEX on XX/XX/XXXX for another 61 minutes. They said they can not take my XXXX card ( or any non-AMEX card ), they will not let me mail in a payment, and they will not let me use an AMEX that is not in my name. I asked them how to make the change. They said they could call XXXX XXXX back and see if their answer changes. This time, they told me I have to drive down to the departures gate at my local airport and have them make the change. I'm now 5 hours into calls. \n\nSo on XX/XX/XXXX, I drive to XXXX  and spend another 3 hours in travel and time there. At the airport, I am told they also can not help me. I paid {$9.00} in parking fees and am now XXXX hours into figuring out how it's possible to make flight changes. I've tried using my money, I've tried using a friend 's card, I've tried mailing money, I've tried driving to the airport. How is it possible to make this reservation change? The agent at XXXX XXXX recommended I file this complaint as he said he can not think of any other workaround.",
