XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I realized I never recieved a card or statement from XXXX. I contacted customer service to notify that I have not recieved anything but I wanted to pay the balance and close the account. Which I thought I did. XX/XX/XXXX my husband and I apply for HELOC and bank notifies me that my credit score is XXXX because of outstanding balance of XXXX to Comennity Bank. I still never recieved a statement in the mail or email. Comenity Bank called a couple times but I didn't answer assuming it was a scam call because I wasn't aware of having any loans with them. I contacted Comenity Bank and immediatly paid the XXXX ( although I should have disputed but trying to fix my credit score fast for HELOC ). The agent explained that when I paid off the balance owed and closed the account, Comenity Bank charged me interest the next day, which I was unaware of and accummulated into the {$140.00} -- of their fees and charges on this closed account. I also verifyed my address on file which was still wrong. It was an address I hadn't lived in over 12 years and definitely was not on my license. XX/XX/XXXX several days later I called Comenity Bank again requesting my account number so I could pull information up online so I could write to Comenity with the statements asking them to reverse the credit score and refund the ( XXXX + the now {$2.00} ). I never had the account number and I was unable to set up online to view the account. During this call I asked to double check there was no balacne and the account was closed -- I asked her to say the amount out loud so I could record -- which she said I wasn't allowed to do but the credit card company has recordings of all conversations. That is when I was notifed that I was charged AGAIN ( {$2.00} ) and would need to pay it off -- on the same closed account. This is two times this company has charged interest to me on a closed account. I have had excellent credit for 30 years and I would have never let a minimal charge ruin my credit if I would have known about it.",
