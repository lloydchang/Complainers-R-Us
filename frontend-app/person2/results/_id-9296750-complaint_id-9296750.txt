The attempt failed with a note 'fraudulent credit card info '. A second attempt was made after reentering my credit card info. Again a note saying \" frudulent credit card info '. At this point, I suspecting my time limit had expired I decided NOT TO PURCHASE the item. So, I terminated the website connection.\n\nI now received a text message from Barclays asking to confirm an online purchase from the online company. I called Barclays and told them what had happened and refused the charge. Within 5 min of the first text a second Barclays text came about an online purchase from the same company. I called Barclays again and explained the situation and refused the charge. I ALSO REQUESTED BARCLAYS NOT ACCEPT ANY CHARGE FROM THE ONLINE COMPANY THE TWO PREVIOUS BARCLAYS PURCHASE VERIFICATIONS WERE FROM. The next day I checked my account and there was a transaction from the online company for the product I did not want.\n\nI contacted Barclays Dispute Department and explained the entire series of events and I was asked if it was a fraudulent charge. Based on what happened above and the text messages using the words 'fraudulent ' I said I guess. That comment caused my situation to be sent to the Barclays Fraud Department. I again explained the situation and Barclays opened a Fraud report. I was contacted later by the Barclays Fraud Department and explained the situation again to a Barclays Fraud Dep supervisor ( XXXX ). She explained to me that is was not a fraud matter and she said the fraud incident would be CANCELED and told me to submit a dispute. I then went to the dispute department and was told to submit a letter to Barclays Dispute Dep requesting to established a dispute. After 14+ days I got a letter from Barclays denying the dispute. I called the dispute department and explained to the dispute rep that I had contacted the online company and had received a Return Merchandise Authorization ( RMA ) from the online company and that the product had been confirmed returned by the online company. I was asked to generate another letter to Barclays Dispute Department explaining what had occurred and requesting to reopen the dispute. \nI called Barclays on XX/XX/year> and was told the dispute could not be established because the matter was initially treated as a 'fraud ' and once treated as a fraud it could not be handled as a 'dispute '.
