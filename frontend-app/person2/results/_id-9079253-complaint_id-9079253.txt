I had to tell that employee twice to get me a supervisor. The supervisor gave me incorrect info according to the supervisor I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX who also told me there was nobody else to escalate this issue to and now the merchant has to wait until possibly XX/XX/XXXX to get their money which means I have been waiting over 59 days for the issue to be resolved through the Dispute Department which they have failed at on now 6 different calls. I want someone to get to a high level executive at Chase Bank Visa where this credit card is from and make them aware of the lousy way this has been handled.",
