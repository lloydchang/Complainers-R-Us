  "complaint_what_happened": "On XX/XX/XXXX - Wells Fargo refused my request to charge back a bogus charge by a financial company for {$7000.00} for BUSINESS CAPITAL -- Not Credit Cards. The company advertised up to {$150000.00} in Business Capital for that XXXX fee. On XX/XX/XXXX which was the first day that the financial company starting the process, I recognized they were simply applying for credit cards using my credit score and personal information -- I told them on the spot -- this is not what you advertised nor is this Business Capital -- it's creditr cards! They said they work with companies that can get capital off of the credit cards -- I said oh noooo, I need capital not credit cards. We go back and forth and the company wants to haggle over why credit cards is better or the same as capital -- I cancel this order over the phone and in writing. I then call Wells Fargo to dispute this 1 day old charge and Wells Fargo tells me no!!!!! They say I need to file a police report about this matter! I tell them, that's absurd. I have the right to deny a charge -- especially within 24 hours for sure. \nIt's not like I have received anything tangible. Surely no capital in 24 hours. Wells Fargo tells me too bad so sad. Since this initial XXXX interaction with Wells Fargo, they have ( Wells Fargo ) maliciously taken money over {$5000.00} out of my accounts and and sent it to another entity -- on there own. Charged my Wells Fargo Credit Card {$7000.00} and threatened to ruin my credit profile and FICO score with the 3 Credit Bureaus. \n\nThis is beyond outrageous! Wells Fargo needs to be put out of business. How many outrageous, harmful, destructive violations does Wells Fargo get to commit against consumers before they are put out of business -- not just fined and change executives. \n\nFrom the Housing Scandal ( under XXXX XXXX ) to a litany of other violations, why does Wells Fargo get to just pay a fine and shuffle the executive chairs and continue on with predatory malicious vicious unethical business practices? Close Wells Fargo down and sell off the assets to other banks -- do not let the simply pay a fine and change executives ; their culture stays the same no matter who is top dog. \n\nPlease CFPB, stop Wells Fargo on this matter and 100s of thousands of others. They are the same wolf no matter how they change executives or even their business name. \n\nWells Fargo must be closed down just XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX under XXXX XXXX, Break Wells Fargo up and sell off the parts and assets.",
