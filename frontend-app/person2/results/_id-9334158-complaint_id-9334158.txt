I was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX  for extremely, extremely XXXX XXXX XXXX. While in the XXXX XXXX XXXX gave me XXXX which they werent supposed to give me XXXX for any reason & I am XXXX XXXX  to XXXX. I found out later that they gave me the XXXX which caused me to have to be resuscitated 3 times. Due to their drastic XXXX XXXX  error, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I am currently having XXXX XXXX as a result of the XXXX giving me the XXXX in error. I couldnt do absolutely nothing. I had to go through XXXX XXXX. I was in XXXX XXXX. \n\nI finally was XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I received an alert to my credit report which came to my phone via text and my daughter reluctantly informed me because of my XXXX and I was, as I am currently in the XXXX process. The alert, said that Barclays had put a 30 day late payment on my credit reports for XXXX. I called Barclay and informed them prior to me going in the hospital, I made a {$350.00} payment. \n\nI had no idea I would be rushed to the XXXXXXXX nor did I know what occurred to me would occur to me while in the XXXX, that was out of my control. I explained to the customer service representative about the 30 day derogatory mark that was placed on my credit report and I didnt understand why as I did make a payment prior to going in the XXXX  and I had no idea that I would have that life altering experience to transpire. \n\nI was told my account was not in a late 30 day late status and I should not have had a 30 late payment reporting on my credit report. I asked what was my payment currently due and the representative stated {$600.00} which I immediately paid. I didnt understand why because my monthly bill shouldnt have been that much but I paid it to maintain my good status. If you look at my credit report it states monthly payment {$320.00} which I attached. \n\nI asked for a manager because I stated that this 30 day credit reporting is not correct. I asked that this be removed immediately as I have been a stellar paying customer since receiving the credit card in XXXX. As well, before going into the XXXX, I made a payment of {$350.00} in XXXX. \n\nThe representative indicated I had to write the company which I did. Then I immediately called the credit bureaus and disputed the derogatory 30 reporting for XXXX and the very next day Barclay put another 30 day late history for XXXX on my credit reports, I was astonished, which I attached a screenshot showing that. I called back to Barclays and stated that you have now reported two 30 day late payments on my credit reports for XXXX and XXXX. I requested a supervisor. \n\nI spoke with XXXX, who stated that there shouldnt be any derogatory reporting on my credit report and I informed her though youre stating it shouldnt be any reporting of a derogatory status, it is. I asked to speak with a supervisor and she advised me to write in to Barclays, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I called back to speak with a supervisor, I had a long wait but I spoke to XXXX, who stated she was a supervisor and stated they could not update and remove the derogatory reporting that I had to contact them and they would remove. XXXX stated I could only contact Barclays via mail, even though I requested a phone number, fax or email as this situation is of urgency. \n\nI wrote the company and was astonished at the companys response, sending me a letter saying they werent removing the incorrect information and they also reduced my credit limit. I need this incorrect information removed and my credit limit restored. I have been an extremely loyal customer, please check the payment history, never 30 days late, excellent payment history. \n\nI work extremely hard to have a good rapport with not only Barclays but all of my creditors. I am extremely upset how this has tarnished by credit. I asked that this is removed immediately. I recently found out that it was notated as XXXX XXXX ( reference no. XXXX ) but I have been a stellar customer Please see the attached picture to show you I was in the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This picture was given to me by my daughter who can attest to my condition & my XXXX stay. She took the picture to show me my condition due to XXXX neglect and to support the condition I was in due to the incompetency of the XXXX. \n\nI have attached a screenshot of the 30 day derogatory reporting for XXXX & XXXX. Also, I am attaching that I paid {$350.00} in XXXX and that it says my monthly payment is {$320.00} on my credit reports. I have a screenshot of payments-March XXXX {$350.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$300.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$600.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$330.00}. \n\nPlease review payment history, hospital picture attached, monthly payment screenshot {$320.00} Late payments on credit reports. \n\nMy name on the account is XXXX XXXX Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX",
