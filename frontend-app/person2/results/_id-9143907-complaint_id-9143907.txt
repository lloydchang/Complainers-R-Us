She informed me that I had {$32.00} in their regular savings account and {$220.00} in XXXX XXXX XXXX I sent a check for the balance on my monthly statement ( {$1000.00} ) and a 2nd check in the amount of {$360.00}, which XXXX said would pay my account in full. Those checks were cashed by PenFed on XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nHowever, in XXXX, XXXX, I received another statement from PenFed claiming that I had a balance of {$160.00} due, which included a {$21.00} fee.

I sent in a check for that amount on XX/XX/XXXX which was cashed on XX/XX/XXXX with the understanding that my account was now finally closed. \n\nIn XXXX, XXXX I was notified by PenFed that my account still was not closed. I spoke with XXXX who informed me that my card was closed but my account was not. She transferred me to XXXX who said she could remove charges for two different automatic payments ( which admittedly I had forgotten to cancel ). I explained to her that my XXXX XXXX autopayment had been rejected so didn't understand why the other two had been accepted. She confirmed that I should have had a XXXX balance for XXXX. She stated that I had {$37.00} in my savings account with PenFed. I was then transferred to XXXX who said she had to present my case to her supervisor to get the credits approved and bring my account to closure. She said it might take until the next day but that she would call me back when it was approved and that they would mail me a check for the {$37.00} in my savings account. She didn't call back. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) I called PenFed and spoke to XXXX. She said that the XXXX charges were still on my card and that PenFed would not close my account until I paid. She said she would have a supervisor call me but this didn't happen so I called back. This time ( XXXX ) I spoke to XXXX who said that I still owed for XXXX charges even though I had requested account closure in XXXX, XXXX. \n\nI have spent a few hours on the phone with these people and put on hold for minutes and minutes at a time and multiple times in each phone call.",
