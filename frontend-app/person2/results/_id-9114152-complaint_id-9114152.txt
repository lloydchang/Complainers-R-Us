  "complaint_what_happened": "To Whom It May Concern : I am writing to file a complaint against Discover Card for falsely advertising the charges on my account. Below are the details of my complaint : Background : On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a flight purchase on XXXX XXXX XXXX totaling XXXX XXXX XXXX dollars ( please refer to the attached purchase receipt ) using my Discover Card ending in XXXX. The purchase triggered a Discover Card fraud alert, and I received an email alert asking me to approve the total charge of {$3000.00} ( please see the attached email screenshot ). I called Discover Card on a recorded line on XX/XX/XXXX, to facilitate this transaction. Specifically, I inquired about the amount of this transaction in US dollars. The agent informed me that the total was {$3000.00} in US dollars. On XX/XX/XXXX, my credit card indeed had a pending charge of {$3000.00}, consistent with the Discover Card email alert and the specialist on the phone. However, as of XX/XX/XXXX, I was surprised to find that I was charged {$3000.00} by Discover Card ( please refer to the attached Discover Card activity screenshot ), which is significantly different from what I was informed about by email and on the phone. Please note that when I authorized this purchase, I only authorized {$3000.00}. \n\nPlease do not blame or pass the responsibility to the merchant. As shown in the receipt and the Discover Card activity screenshot, XXXX XXXX XXXX charged the correct amount of XXXX XXXX XXXX dollars, and they have not made any additional charges. It is Discover Card that added an unknown and unauthorized {$48.00}. Please do not make an excuse based on foreign exchange rate differences. I was told by both discover card phone agent and discover card system-issued email that the charge was {$3000.00}, which was computed by discover card system taking into account the foreign exchange rate at the time of purchase. \n\nNote that Discover Card advertises not charging foreign transaction fees ( see this link XXXX XXXX XXXX ), which is why I used Discover Card to make this purchase. If I had known that Discover Card would charge more than the advertised rate, I would not have used Discover Card to make this purchase. \n\nSteps Taken to Resolve : I contacted Discover Card on XX/XX/XXXX, through online chat. First, I spent one hour with the online agent XXXX, who gave various excuses for this incorrect {$3000.00} charge. She blamed the merchant and quoted that Discover Card used a special foreign exchange rate. I disputed all her claims by showing her the proofs that Discover Card showed me the charge as {$3000.00} after I made the purchase. Then she said she was working on it and asked me to wait. I waited for another 20 minutes and just found out she silently left the chat, wasting another 20 minutes ( see attached screenshot ). \n\nConclusion : As a loyal Discover Card customer since XXXX, I am disappointed with the lack of transparency of this charge, the handling of this matter, and the lack of resolution provided by customer service. There is ample evidence in discover card system showing the initial charge was {$3000.00}. Please review the email communications between Discover Card and me and review the recorded line on XX/XX/XXXX. Instead of finding excuses to justify the higher amount, please escalate this issue to someone who can help refund the overcharge of {$48.00}. It's important to note that charging more than the advertised or disclosed amount may lead to legal action, including involving the District Attorney 's office or initiating a class action lawsuit. I kindly request the CFPBs assistance in resolving this issue promptly and fairly. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a swift resolution. \n\nSincerely,",
