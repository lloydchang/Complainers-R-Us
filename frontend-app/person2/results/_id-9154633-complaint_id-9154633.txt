Chunk:
i've had this credit card for over 35 years and it's been sold around a lot. the current interest rate i have ( grandfathered in ) is 14 %, which makes it attractive for me to keep and for the company that owns it not attractive. when it was most recently purchased by 1st horizon bank, i asked how to make online payments. i was told to open a checking account with the bank which is based in tn. i did not wish to do so, so have been using the pay - by - phone feature, which frankly seems rather xxxx century, but whatever. now, more recently they have updated their payment terms / system and when i call in i receive a'we can not make a payment on this account, please wait while we transfer you'and then the call hangs up. additionally, i think if you choose to pay over the phone with a representative, they charge a fee, which - no way. so am i left to only pay via paper check and mail? i get the sense that this company wants me and my 14 % interest rate card to take my business elsewhere. i, on the other hand, would like to continue to use this card to my benefit. but i do need to find a way of making payments somehow. and not have the. phone system randomly hang up on me or refuse to take my money. when i called a 4th time just now, it said today is not a day where customer services reps are available. great. fun.
