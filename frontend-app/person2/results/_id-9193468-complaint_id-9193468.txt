  "complaint_what_happened": "I requested that my account be closed in XXXX of XXXX and it wasn't. So they charged me again for a monthly XXXX  service and charged me a late fee on top of that. \nI talked with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and told her my account should have been closed and she said she could look into it and put in a request. I got a letter on XX/XX/XXXX stating they would respond about the dispute as quickly as possible. I then received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX saying that I didn't close my account until after the reoccurring charge date, which is not accurate because I requested it in XXXX. I then received a bill in XXXX for {$31.00}. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX and she told me I only owed {$22.00} ( for their mistake of not closing my account and letting my card be charged again ). They were trying to charge me another late fee and I told her I wasn't paying it. I made out a check that day and sent it in because I wanted to be done with this. Then I get another bill in XXXX for {$64.00} and they were trying to charge me for the previous amount ( That I already sent a check in for and they cashed on XXXX ) and charge another late fee of {$31.00} and {$2.00} interest charge. I called again and the automated system told me I owed {$2.00}. I then talked with XXXX and she told me I didn't owe anything and it would take 1-2 business days to process. Again, I get another bill in XXXX for {$4.00} for the interest charges. I just ignored it because at this point I was extremely fed up. I then get another bill in XXXX saying I owed {$6.00}. I called the number they left on my voicemail and it was useless as I was on hold for XXXX minutes with no response. So I called the number on the bill and the automated system told me I owed {$8.00}. Once someone finally answered at XXXX I told her I wanted to speak with a supervisor. At XXXX she told me they were getting a supervisor on the line. She came back on at XXXX and told me a supervisor wasn't available and to wait a few more minutes. XXXX came back on at XXXX and still no supervisor. I told her I was not waiting any longer for a supervisor. I also said that she needed to tell her supervisor that this is getting to be harassment and that I will contact a lawyer if need be because they should be able to read my file and know that I don't owe money. If they bothered to do their job right they would know this. I told her I was done and that someone needed to figure this out. NEVER received a call from a supervisor, but I did get another bill on XX/XX/XXXX saying I owe {$8.00}. I sent the paystub back with a letter attached to it stating all of the above and they still keep calling me. I'm completely fed up with this company and something needs to be done with them because they filed a complaint against my credit score when it isn't even my fault. They need to fix my credit report. I also shouldn't have had to pay them for their mistake because they didn't listen in XXXX when I said to close my account. They wasted my valuable time being on hold for all the calls/minutes and money I spent for something they should be held accountable for.",
