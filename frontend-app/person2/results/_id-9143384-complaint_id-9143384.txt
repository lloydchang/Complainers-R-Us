PLEASE READ CLAIM NUMBER XXXX MORE THOROUGHLY, IF YOU STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND CALL ME I originally filed several disputed back in or around XXXX or XXXX of XXXX. Citi Bank dropped the ball after receiving the disputes. Shortly after I had fraud committed on the account and was completely locked out from accessing XXXX - XXXX statements for the year of XXXX. Citi bank could not access these records either. It took them at least 6 months to get me these statements. After receiving the statements in question, I wrote a letter, submitted documentation and requested the disputes be filed again. I understand the law gives x amount of days, but these is an exception considering they dropped the ball after I initially filed and then I had no access due to fraud. Citi Bank received the envelope by mail on XX/XX/XXXX. I called to follow up with Citi Bank several times, pertaining to these disputes. All I was ever told was that \" Citi Bank did receive the envelope and they were working on it ''. I followed up on them, because I did not receive anything from Citi Bank via mail, confirming they received the package or confirming they were actually investigating. In or around XXXX of XXXX, I spoke with a male representative at Citi Bank. He told me the same as the last agent I spoke with. He did disclose that Citi Bank investigates for 90 days which would have been XX/XX/XXXX according to him. I informed him that I would follow up one more time after that date to see what is going on. I called Citi Bank yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, and spoke with a female supervisor. Long story short, NO ONE at Citi Bank did anything with my package. Whomever received it opened it, read it, but not re-open the disputes or file any of the documentation I submitted. The supervisor just did all this yesterday, again 93 days after receiving my package. Because Citi Bank failed their due diligence and filing/re-opening the disputes in a timely manner I am now demanding that the disputed amounts be credited back to my account, which is a total of {$1100.00} https : XXXX The card issuer must send you a letter stating that it has received your billing dispute within 30 days of receiving it and complete its investigation within XXXX complete billing cycles which generally means it can not take longer than 90 days. https : XXXX Generally, the bank must mail or deliver written acknowledgement to you within 30 days of receiving your written billing error notice.
