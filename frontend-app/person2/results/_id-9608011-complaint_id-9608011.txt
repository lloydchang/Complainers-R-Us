This letter is a direct response to my complaint filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), copy enclosed for ease of reference. \n\nWith reference to your letter, I would like to correct some facts for the record : Citibank claims in the XXXX  line of the letter ( XX/XX/XXXX ) that I opened an account in XXXX and was awarded a Platinum Select Card. For the record, I moved to the United States in XXXX and was not in a position to open an account with Citibank since, at that time, I was unemployed and was in the process of establishing the necessary residency paperwork. That being said, I did not open an account with Citibank nor was I in possession of any credit cards. \n\nCitibank claims that I owe a large debt on a Platinum Select Card ; however, I have never received any notice of this debt and I do not owe this debt. \n\nCitibanks attorney claims that I was served with a notice and that I lived at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, NJ XXXX. I have never lived in XXXX XXXX, NJ, and I never been served since I have been a resident of the State of Virginia  for more than a decade. It appears that Citibank is aware that I do not live in New Jersey since your letter was addressed correctly to my Virginia address. \n\nIt has come to my attention that Citibank may be pursuing garnishment of my wages for a debt that I am not responsible for and would seek legal counsel to protect my interest. \n\nPlease correct your records accordingly and inform all Citibanks legal representatives of these errors. I would appreciate if you would inform me when this matter is resolved. \nRespectfully, XXXX XXXX",
