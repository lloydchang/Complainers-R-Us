I call customer service the first person I spoke said since my account was closed they wont adjust the interest and he couldnt hear me. I called in an hour later I called and spoke to someone and they said I need to pay 2 consecutive months total balance in order to not get anymore interest. I requested a manager she said she wont waive the fee and I shouldve called in for a pay off. I said o line gave me the option to pay the total amount why didnt online reflect what I actually owed? I would like the interest of XXXX to be reimbursed I paid them over XXXX and thats what it said I owed this is such a scam",
