This has been a moving target ; last time, American Express noted that the merchant said we never canceled the installation, and we provided that information. Then, American Express called us and told us we canceled the dispute, which we didnt. Now, the merchant states we didnt allow him to complete the installation.

After XX/XX/XXXX, measurement/inspection of the doors and installation was done by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who concluded that the doors were manufactured to be too small in their frames and would be replaced by the manufacturer. We also conveyed in writing and orally that the retrofit installation was totality jammed over our old door frames and was not what we ordered. \n\nThe merchant would not allow a XXXX representative to come until the moldings and gaps of the old frame could be covered with cladding. We insisted that we did not want the retrofit installation covered up and wanted XXXX to inspect the doors first. The merchant refused, so we canceled the installation. At no time did we ever prevent the merchant from completing the installation. The installation was not what we ordered. The doors were purchased, paid for, and installed using American Express. The doors, as manufactured in their frames, are too small.
