  "complaint_what_happened": "In XX/XX/XXXX I tried to use the earned points on my credit card issued by Elan Financial Services but I could not get it to work ; I called their Customer Service who directed my online steps to apply the points because the points were soon to expire. However, when the next billing statement was received, a charge to my card was listed and nothing about the points. I called Elan to report this unauthorized charge to my card and their fraud department promised to investigate. I received a letter from that department date XX/XX/XXXX which confirmed our phone conversation and their promise. \n\nHowever, the charge continued to appear on our billing statements. On XX/XX/XXXX I called the company again and spoke with XXXX who said the charge, late and interest fees would be reversed ; she also switched my call to XXXX in the fraud department. I tried to explain the entire situation to XXXX but she kept rudely interrupting me. I demanded that I receive their documentation that proves the charge was specifically authorized by me. The charge continued to appear on the billing statements for the next few months, together with accumulating late and interest charges. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I wrote a certified letter to Elan to clearly state my protest about this unauthorized charge and the rude behavior of their staff in the fraud department. I formally requested their documentation of proof that the charge was duly authorized by me, since XXXX sent no such documentation to me. My letter also stated that all documentation be received by me within thirty calendar days from the date of the letter receipt. In addition, the letter demanded that all charges be reversed from my account and all negative reports to credit agencies be retracted. Their letter to me dated XX/XX/XXXX acknowledged my cease and desist request and that my account was placed in a cease-and-desist status. \n\nShortly after receipt of their XX/XX/XXXX letter I received another letter from Elan dated XX/XX/XXXX which stated they had investigated my claim and determined the charge was authorized and would be reapplied to my account. Their letter also stated I have a right to receive copies of the documentation used during their research ; no such documentation has ever been received despite my written demands to them. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I wrote another certified letter to Elan again restating my demand that Elan provide clear evidence of my specific authorization to charge my credit card. The letter also restated my demand to receive documentation of the assistance I received by their staff in applying points for the transaction. \n\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I wrote another certified letter which stated that I have received no documentation from Elan for any of my verbal and written demands, despite my courtesy of granting them thirty calendar days to do so. However, as a further courtesy the letter granted them a final thirty calendar days to fully comply with all of my demands. \n\nTo date, XX/XX/XXXX, no response has been received, no documentation has been received, and the billing statements continue to accumulate late and interest charges. The total now appearing on the statement is over three times the amount of the original disputed charge.",
