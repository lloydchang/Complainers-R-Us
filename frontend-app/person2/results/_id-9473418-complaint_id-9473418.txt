All over just a few people filing a COMPLAINT against me, for taking too long to honor my 100 % refund policy of their initial {$1.00} activation fee! \n\nAll while there were as many as XXXX {$1.00} activation completed TRANSACTIONS within my XXXX account, by that time! \n\nNeedless to say, NO ONE ELSE filed a complaint, and I ended up getting 100 % of my balance released, after those 6 months had already passed! \n\nSo, here I was in the XXXX of XXXX, bantering with a XXXX salesman, who was speaking to me in PERFECT XXXX! \n\nAll while being surrounded by such a luxurious, Garden of XXXX like of resort, that was right on the XXXX XXXX, and he was selling me, just like I was currently IN XXXX! \n\nSo, I signed the contract, and HOPED everything they were promising was at least 50 % TRUE! \n\nOver the next 5 months, I 100 % paid off the ENTIRE {$35000.00}, including paying off my {$10000.00} XXXX XXXX balance, and cancelling that card, and paying off what what I later discovered to be a {$2000.00} Barclays Bank credit card, that they had order \" for me '', and paying their {$23000.00} \" resort property '' account balance, through XXXX payments! \n\nObviously, it was ALL A 100 % SCAM! \n\nThey were SO SLICK, I couldn't even discover for sure it was a SCAM, until 18 months later, when I finally, became QUALIFED to start collecting over {$15000.00} PER YEAR, as rent from their vacationers, @ $ XXXX by me \" banking '' in XXXX of each year, my XXXX \" OWNED '' weeks. Or, me coming back down there, to use those XXXX weeks for my own vacations there. Or, me posting MY \" owned '' XXXX full weeks of vacation time on XXXX, at whatever price, over their {$3000.00} weekly minimum guarantee, I can get through XXXX. \n\nBy then, even If I had made all XXXX payments, over all of that QUALIFICATION time, they knew for sure, it would have been well beyond XXXX 's 6 month 's dispute period, and obviously I chose, to foolishly make put those purchases on XXXX XXXX, and Barclays XXXX cards, so there was no dispute recourse. \n\nSo, my real complaint is how can these MAJOR XXXX and XXXX banking XXXX, be allowed to be a party to such a grossly scandalous place? \n\nAll XXXX of their XXXX Banking XXXX member NAMES alone, as legitimate XXXX options, gave that place 100 %, instant CREDIBILITY! \n\nAfter signing a contract, hoping they were being at least hallway honest, I discovered they have copious complaints, all over the internet, going way back, well over 15 years, under that business XXXX, and also, under other business Names. \n\nRecently, they changed the XXXX of the place yet again, to XXXX XXXX... \n\nI guess it was because their SCAM had already run its course, under the now totally SCAMMY Name XXXX XXXX! \n\nBut, XXXX thing is almost for CERTAIN, they are still in GOOD STANDING with XXXX XXXX, Barclays Bank, and XXXX ...
