I made my regular minimum pymt and then called and requesting making a pymt over the phone to pay the bal of the offer expiring XX/XX/XXXX.

They said I need to wait for my statment after XX/XX/XXXX- then pay that offer which will have the interest added. They said if I pay it right away no interest will be charged. They will not put that in writing to me but said they are noting my file. I found on your website regarding XXXX ( i ) Last two billing cycles- where it says I can allocate funds in order to not go past my expiration date to pay off that transfer. I do not trust that a note on my file is confirmation that I won't be chaged the interest and don't understand why they won't accept an additional payment to fulfill that transfer. I just had the same situation with another card - made the same kind of call and they did allocate the funds as I requested with no problem. So I believe CitiBank should also have to do that.",
