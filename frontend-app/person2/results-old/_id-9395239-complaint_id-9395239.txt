All four places had problems- XXXXXXXX XXXX place had bugs, I had rash all over my body, her bathroom was not permitted, was too small, One can not stand in the Bath area, and take a shower, the shower was too close to the head, all the cold water used to come straight on the head, if you move little bit in the bath area, you used to hit your hands on the walls of the shower area. Bathroom was not clean either, there was no kitchen over there to be used, sink was dirty and too close to the wall, hand used to hit on the wall while using the sink. \nEverything was explained over the phone when the dispute claim was filed, I don't know why you guys are lying that you guys don't know the details of the Dispute. \nSecond dispute with XXXX XXXX Free Parking Near DC, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX '', there was so much of problem at his place, there was no dedicated parking, I had to wait for one hour each time for someone to leave and park my car, he had fake liquid soap, the soap didn't make any leather, and his apartment had bed bugs and roaches. \nThird I went to XXXX XXXX  \" XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX '', she had no parking available, refrigerator has no space, room was on the 2nd floor with no elevator, I had to manually take my luggage on the second floor, room had no lights, the lights were not working, the circuit of the room was getting shot again and again, there was no table in the room. The bathroom was dirty, there was no toilet paper holder, sink was dirty with full of hair, The towels were brought brand new from XXXX and were never washed before they were kept in the Bathroom. \nIt was a cold weather in XXXX DC around that time, and no thermostat access was provided, The cold Air conditioner was on the whole night, I couldn't sleep there the whole night, I was shivering the whole night, when I got up in the morning there were rashes all over my body, and I had to leave the place because of this. I only stayed there one night, so why did XXXX charged me {$570.00}? When she did not provide any service, I didn't even take a shower over there as the bathroom was dirty. XXXX filed a claim of {$100.00}, which was a fraud claim and XXXX paid her that {$100.00}, I don't know what was that {$100.00} claim for. \nNow coming to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX did not have any appliances, any utensils, no XXXX, XXXX soap bottle was empty, no stove to cook, no cuttlery and board to cut fruits, vegetables, no heater in the room, the closet had no hangers, and the bathroom shower curtain was a joke as it was so small. \nNo amenities as mentioned in the description was provided. I booked her place for {$290.00} and after two nights, the owner promised that she will bring a microwave and other things as mentioned in the description, as I already moved a lot in that trip and didn't want to move more, I said ok and sent a request to extend the trip for two more days, the trip should have extended for the same price of {$290.00}, but instead I do not know what happened, it extended for {$360.00} for two days, which is a clear cheating by XXXX and the host, and moreover, no microwave and other things were brought by the host as promised. \nI opened disputed for all of these transactions and I was told that I will be given temporary credit for the transactions, and I will get a final credit after 90 days of investigation. No credit was ever given to me, and the investigation was never initiated. And then because of your lazy and incompetent staff, they ultimately told me that I never provided any evidence for the disputes, which is completely false, I provided evidence for each and every dispute. \nMultiple complains were filed against Amex XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), but Amex went unaffected by all the complaints made. \nBecause of all this I need my {$2100.00} back. \nThen in the month of XX/XX/XXXX Fraudulent activity was reported on the account as my card was lost in the amount of {$4300.00}, I was told that I will be given a temporary credit, it will not be reported to my credit bureaus, and no Late fee and interest will be charged on my account, nothing of that sought happened. \nI was charged late fee and interest charges every month, the credit bureaus were reported which brought my credit rating from XXXX to XXXX right now. \nOn XX/XX/XXXX - Late fee - {$30.00}, XX/XX/XXXX - Interest charges - {$100.00}, XX/XX/XXXX Late fee of {$41.00}, XX/XX/XXXX Interest charges - {$96.00}, XX/XX/XXXX Late fee - {$41.00}, XX/XX/XXXX Interest charges - {$83.00}, XX/XX/XXXX Late fee - {$30.00}, XX/XX/XXXX Interest charges - {$78.00} Total in late fee and interest charges are - {$500.00} Lots of complaints were made to CFPB and XXXX regarding this matter but to no avail. \nWhen received the Flyer of the Amex XXXX XXXX, it was mentioned in the flyer that it has a XXXX fraud Liability, when I did not purchase anything from the card and reported it as fraudulent, why the bank is making me liable for the Fraudulent charges? \nOn the top of that, instead of giving me a temporary credit for the fraudulent activities and then doing the investigation, Amex never gave me any temporary credit and from Day one started to charge me interest. \nCustomer service at Amex is a nonsense, and nothing else. First of all its takes a lot of time over the phone to reach a customer service personnel, and once you do they ask you multiple quesitons to verify you, after that they promise you that you will be given a temporary credit and you never receive a temporary credit. \nAmex has done nothing but fraud with me, because of Amex I went through a lot of mental harassment, my XXXX XXXX went up, and I went through financial stress as well. \nI tried it in every way outside the court, to resolve the issue with Amex but Amex forced me to bring this matter to the court as I had no other option. \nAll the staff of Amex is very careless and unprofessional, they never acknowledge that I already sent all the evidence to Amex already, there staff come forward and blabber whatever comes in their mouth without looking at the XXXX XXXX or the computer records. \n\" The Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) is a federal law that protects consumers from unfair credit billing practices ' was not followed in the \" disputes '' and \" fraudulent charges '' reported. \nCalifornia has also adopted \" The Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) '' and I should have been protected under this law, and I wasn't. All Amex is going after is greed, it is not following state and federal laws, Amex wants to keep all the money in its pocket unfairly, and doesn't provide justice to its consumers. \nThis case also falls under \" Consumers Legal Remedies Act '', \" Consumers Legal Remedies Act '' is a set of laws that protects consumers from unfair business practices, fraud, and false advertising. \nIt's also known as California Civil Code 1750 et seq.
