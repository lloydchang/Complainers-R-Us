Weve called them multiple times to answer the same questions over and over again. We filled out paperwork and signed it and sent it back. I mean, we have jumped through all the hoops that the bank has requested, and it continues to go on and on and on and on and the most recent letter dated XX/XX/year> they said after a, detailed review of your claim based on the information available we have concluded that the transactions identified are not fraudulent. The part that we cant figure out how you came to that conclusion you have yet to show me any proof and you dont have any lets face it and you know how I can make that statement with 100 % confidence is that we know for fact that we did not have the card in our possession during the time that the transactions were made. We did not give anybody permission to use the card, neither myself nor my husband benefit in anyway from the transactions on the account, we have repeatedly asked the bank to provide some proof and all we get these form letters and when you occasionally do send us a letter its still very vague for example one of the last letters you sent us with just a little bit of information you said that and I dont have the letter right in front of me so I cant read it Word for Word but basically in a nutshell, we said we were traveling which means that we mustve been traveling in that area and we use the card which is just not true. I dont know how you come to that assumption. We never said we were traveling in that state which the card was used in multiple different states which I found very odd but again you think that were responsible for it. I dont know how we couldve possibly been in all of those places at one time and just because we were traveling doesnt mean that we use this card. We didnt have it in our possession. It was lost/stolen. I dont know exactly when it happened if I wouldve known that, I wouldve called you even sooner, but we cant be at fault for not knowing that someone had stolen our credit card and was using it you claim you have a zero liability but youre not following your own rules. XXXX XXXX they all have rules about this and you are not following them. We both know it exactly what is it that you do in this detail review of my claim I mean, what exactly are you looking at? Why are you so secretive? Why wont you tell me what it? What exactly is it that youre trying to hide, because still you have to give me specifics you give me vague reasonings you said that on the phone you use some of that information what could we possibly said that led you to believe that we are the ones that made the fraudulent transactions I mean Ive gone over in my head XXXX XXXX times and can not figure out one thing that wouldve led you to believe that in anyway youre not following the bank rules according to your website youre not following federal law and you think youre a big bank you can just get away with it, but you can take advantage of your customers youve close the account all because you wont process my fraud claim properly its not my fault you should process the claim you should open the account back up not that we would ever use it at this point because clearly the bank can not be trusted to have our back if anything XXXX forbid happen again, but you shouldnt go closing my account because you feel like it why cant I get somebody to review this? Why cant you tell me specifics dont give me vague answers give me a specific reason why you think we made these transactions stop hiding because if you cant tell or never gon na go away Were also going to file a complaint in the XXXX with the bank. I dont know if itll do as much good but maybe itll draw some attention to the matter Maybe I can get a hold of someone a little higher up they can actually do the right thing and accept your responsibility as the bank with a zero fraud liability",
