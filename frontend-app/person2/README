Understood! Here’s a comprehensive and detailed step-by-step guide, including terminal commands, for your project. You can use these instructions as a base and ask for further details if needed.

1. Dataset Download & Processing
Download the Ruby Dataset
Access the Dataset:

Open Google Drive link in your web browser.
Click “Download” to save the file.
Check File Format:

Determine if the file is in CSV, JSON, or text format.
Transform the Dataset for Text-to-Speech
Install Pandas Library:

Open your terminal and run:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas
Create a Python Script:

Create a file named process_data.py with the following content:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_downloaded_dataset.csv')  # Replace with your file path

# Clean the text data
df['text'] = df['text'].str.replace(r'[^\w\s]', '', regex=True)

# Save cleaned text
df['text'].to_csv('cleaned_text.txt', index=False, header=False)
Run the Python Script:

Execute the script with:
bash
Copy code
python process_data.py
2. Text Classification
Install Hugging Face Transformers
Install the Transformers Library:

Run in your terminal:
bash
Copy code
pip install transformers
Create a Classification Script:

Create a file named classify_text.py with:
python
Copy code
from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize the classifier
classifier = pipeline('text-classification')

# Load transcribed text
with open('transcribed_text.txt', 'r') as file:
    transcribed_text = file.read()

# Classify the text
results = classifier(transcribed_text)

# Print results
print(results)
Run the Classification Script:

Execute the script with:
bash
Copy code
python classify_text.py
3. Testing & Refinement
Test and Evaluate Accuracy
Prepare Sample Texts:

Create text files with sample data. Place them in the same directory as your scripts.
Run Tests:

Replace transcribed_text.txt with your sample files and rerun the classification script:
bash
Copy code
python classify_text.py
Evaluate Results:

Review the output for accuracy.
Make Necessary Adjustments
Tune Model Parameters:

Modify parameters in the script if needed. For Hugging Face models, you may adjust the pipeline configuration.
Refine the Process:

Update your scripts based on test results and re-test.
