  "complaint_what_happened": "In XX/XX/XXXX, I was flagged as a fraudulent person by Home Depot, resulting in a ban from making any returns or transactions. Home Depot claimed my Home Depot Citibank credit card was under investigation for fraud and scamming. Despite never engaging in any fraudulent activities, I was humiliated in the store and treated like a criminal. Home Depot 's staff failed to provide any explanation on how or even why I was flagged, only offering a vague apology stating it must have been a mistake and a {$25.00} gift card, which I refused.\n\nI escalated my concerns to senior leadership at Home Depot and stated my intent to cancel the card due to this unjust treatment. But, I continued to make monthly payments on my Citibank card, which had a {$25000.00} credit limit. Despite paying, sometimes XXXX hours late due to my payday schedule, I maintained a low balance relative to the credit limit. \n\nIn XXXX of XXXX, when I went to pay my monthly bill, I noticed Citibank reduced my credit limit from {$25000.00} to {$3100.00}, bringing my balance extremely close to the limit and drastically increasing my credit utilization ratio. This action adversely affected my credit score, portraying me as a high-risk customer ( 99 % usage ).\n\nWhen I contacted Citibank for an explanation, they echoed Home Depot 's language, labeling me as delinquent and irresponsible, despite my consistent payment history. Citibank 's representative stated that they had reviewed my credit report and preemptively lowered my limit, claiming I was likely to default on their card as well, since they saw I was having trouble with other cards, despite no missed payments on their account. The fact is I was out of work for 3 months and had a payment plan with my mortgage company and car companies and was doing what they told me to do, and unfortunately it still reflected negatively on my credit, because the full balances were not paid. In my anger and frustration over this unfair treatment, I decided not to make any payments in XXXX and XXXX. I let my frustration get the best of me, but this was the FIRST time since having the card that I have ever been this late. \n\nThis treatment feels discriminatory and or very unjust. The decision to reduce my credit limit to my existing balance, combined with derogatory reporting to credit bureaus, has severely impacted my credit standing. Their actions seem punitive and intended to damage my credit reputation unfairly. \n\nXXXX was told I was very delinquent and never paid them, please see attachments from last year to current dates of all payments to Home Depot* they again stated because I was delinquent with them, that is why they took my balance from {$25000.00} to {$3100.00}. \n\nI seek the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's assistance in addressing this unfair treatment and ensuring such practices are not perpetuated against other consumers, especially those that look like me.",
