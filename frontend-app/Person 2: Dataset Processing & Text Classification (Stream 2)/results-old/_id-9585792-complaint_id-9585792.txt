Though the delivery driver tried, there was trouble connecting the ice maker hose and I told them I was ok if they left that uninstalled and I would take care of that on another day. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX - A delivery was scheduled with Best Buys 3rd party delivery team to deliver a partial order : XXXX XXXX, XXXX Dishwasher and XXXX XXXX. Delivery team pulled said items off their truck and the XXXX XXXX was damaged. Damage was pointed out by the delivery driver, and it was advised by the delivery team to refuse the delivery of the damaged item and reschedule delivery for the oven at a later time when one in good condition would be available. This is supported in the evidence marked C, the Best Buy receipt. Page 4 the stove is stated as being delivered on XX/XX/XXXX NOT on XX/XX/XXXX. The actual delivery of the stove is XX/XX/XXXX, which I will address later. \n\nDelivery team proceeds to unload and install the XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX page 2 marked DELIVERY TWO. The XXXX Dishwasher was delivered on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX page 2 titled DELIVERY TWO, but was not installed due to the inability of the delivery team to connect the hose. They advised against kinking the hose to make it work. I agreed and told them I was fine with that and would take care of the dishwasher installation on our end. As evidenced by the picture of the uninstalled dishwasher that BEST BUY provided in your recent correspondence XXXX XXXX. \n\nAt our home the delivery team called their home office so that I could speak with them to schedule a new date for the delivery of a stove in good condition. The woman on the phone told us to call back the next day to schedule this. \n\nAt no time on XX/XX/XXXX did we receive the XXXX XXXX  that we ordered on XX/XX/XXXX, as evidenced by Best Buys own receipt, XXXX XXXX \n\nXX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX Numerous texts and phone calls occur to reschedule the delivery of the XXXX XXXX ordered on XX/XX/XXXX.

XXXX XXXX Account Statement due date XX/XX/XXXX. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX I called Best Buy Card Services to report an erroneous charge and was advised to report it as fraud thus causing Best Buy to cancel the account ending in # XXXX  and reissue a new card with account ending in # XXXX. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX Erroneous charge of {$480.00} is credited to my Best Buy Account, XXXX  XXXX The amount was then moved to change the original total of the order place on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX Which contradicts the original and only agreed upon order total of {$4000.00} XXXX XXXX \n\nXX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX delivers the XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX shown via emails between myself and the local store manager XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX. \n\nXX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX Ongoing phone calls and conversations regarding disputed amount of {$480.00}. Conversations on XX/XX/XXXX with the credit card services ( XXXX XXXX, purchasing department ( XXXX ), Services Department ( XXXX  ), and Credit card services ( XXXX XXXX confirm that : No one at Best Buy can explain the erroneous post of {$480.00} on XX/XX/XXXX No one at Best Buy can explain what item number or product that {$480.00} can be attributed to. \n\nNo one at Best Buy can see the post as current on the account in the amount of {$480.00} No one at Best Buy can explain why my original order placed on XX/XX/XXXX totaling {$4000.00} was adjusted on XX/XX/XXXX to reflect a total of {$4500.00}. \n\nHowever, it was suggested that maybe Best Buy did not receive the stove back from the 3rd party delivery team contracted out by Best Buy. It was recommended to call a Best Buy Shopping Team the next day and request to speak with a manager and explain to them the situation. \n\nDuring this time span I also made 3 separate fax attempts to Citi on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX attempting to prove the amount of the original purchase as well as the fact that no specific information was being given as to where the erroneous charge came from ( XXXX  XXXX ). \n\nXX/XX/XXXX - Called the Best Buy shopping team at XXXX spoke with XXXX and asked for a manager.
