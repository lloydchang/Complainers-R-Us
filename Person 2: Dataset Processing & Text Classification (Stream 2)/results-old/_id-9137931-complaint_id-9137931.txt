He told me about it, so once the charge was made and processed, I went ahead and started a My Chase Plan on it. After I began the plan, I realized that the XXXX charge was entirely refunded to us on the card ( my XXXX  didn't communicate this with me, and I didn't think to look for a refund on this amount on our card ). I called Chase on XX/XX/year>, to let them know that I had accidentally started the plan and I wanted to cancel it. The person over the phone told me that once the plan was processed, that it would recognize the refund and take care of itself. Since they told me this, I didn't think to follow-up on it until I noticed that the plan was still active later on. I called Chase back on XX/XX/year>, and explained the situation to them and asked them if they could cancel the plan. Their response was that once the plan is activated, they generally could not cancel it. The representative that I talked to that day said he would try to escalate it and see if their team could do anything about it. I asked him if they would be sending me a confirmation email once it gets processed and he said they don't do that and that if changes are made, that it would reflect on the card. He advised me to call back after XXXX business days if I didn't see a change on my account. During the time, I had a medical event I was dealing with and wasn't able to follow-up after XXXX business days, so I finally called back on XX/XX/year>. On that day, I was told that they had no record of my request on XX/XX/year>, and that they would try to escalate the issue for resolution [ again ] and to contact them in XXXX business days if I didn't see a change. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter stating that they couldn't cancel the plan, so I decided to call them back that day. When I got a representative on the phone, the person stated that they could not cancel the plan anymore and that if I had called in earlier when the plan was activated ( which I did ), that they might have been able to do something. I asked to speak to a XXXX so they could explain to me why I had to pay an amount on this plan that had already been refunded. When I talked to the XXXX, she explained to me that the amount that was refunded was credited to a different MY Chase Plan I have active and that I wasn't really paying that amount. I understood that, but I asked her about the fees the plan is charging on a monthly basis. She explained that since the plan could not be cancelled, they couldn't do anything about reversing and/or stopping the fees that are being charged. I really don't think this is fair, considering that now I'm paying fees for an amount that was originally refunded.",
