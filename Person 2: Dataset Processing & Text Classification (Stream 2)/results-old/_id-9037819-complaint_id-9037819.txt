  "complaint_what_happened": "I have been trying for several months to lower my balance by sending checks to Barclay by MAIL to transfer part of my balance to a 0 % offer my mother received from her bank. She has kindly offered to help me with her offer, using it to pay part of my balance at Barclays. TWICE I HAD CHECKS SENT and TWICE, Barclay screwed up and the payment was not made!! I I am writing so I have a written record of my complaint, and I want to receive an answer also IN WRITING from Barclay, indicating EXACTLY WHERE I HAVE TO SEND THE CHECK AND WHEN IT WILL BE CREDITED. \nI am extremely frustrated and will not waste my time on phone calls anymore! I have spent too many hours over many phone calls with Barclay, since XXXX. I have explained it is impossible for me to keep making payments at Barclay 's high interest rates. I have been in and out of the hospital since XX/XX/2023 due to a serious XXXX XXXX. I am trying to transfer some of my high debt at Barclays to my mothers bank so I can keep my credit rating, but it has been ridiculously difficult to consummate a simple balance transfer. What kind of a Bank are you? \nI first had my mother 's bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) {$2000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to a representative and was told the balance transfer could NOT BE MADE ELECTRONICALLY and I had to send a PAPER CHECK to XXXX 's main US office in Delaware. I was surprised that a bona fide, modern bank would not be able to receive electronic payments but in good faith I complied. \nXX/XX/XXXX : My mother asked XXXX XXXX XXXX to send the {$2000.00} check there by mail on XX/XX/XXXX, which they did right away. \nXX/XX/XXXX : I saw the payment had not been made so I figured it the paper check was lost in the mail. My mother asked XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX to put a stop payment on that check and to issue another check for the amount of {$2000.00}. \nXX/XX/XXXX : I asked where this second check should be sent, since the first check never made it. Barclay gave me a different address in a po box in California. XXXX XXXX XXXX sent the SECOND PAPER CHECK for {$2000.00} by mail to that address. \nXX/XX/XXXX : Seeing the payment was not made by the second check, I again called Barclay. The rep said that was not the right address and offered to give me a DIFFERENT ADDRESS!! That is, place another stop-payment, be charged for it, and then have XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX send another check by mail!!! I respectfully declined and said I would just wait for it to arrive XX/XX/XXXX : My mother received a letter from her bank saying that Barclays SENT BACK the check, claiming it had the wrong account number!! At this point I figured out that Barclay is playing a dishonest game, trying to avoid transferring my balance there is no other explanation. I called Barclays and they said the check was made out for my bank account at XXXXXXXX XXXX, which is the bank I use to pay Barclay monthly. There is no way my mothers bank made out the check made out a check for that account, because my mother does not have my XXXX account number! So clearly, Barclay is either inept or deliberately messed up the balance transfer. \nI am completely at a loss for words. I am livid that a simple balance transfer has been so difficult. I want to maintain my credit score and am trying very hard to lower my balance at Barclays using an honest balance transfer.",
